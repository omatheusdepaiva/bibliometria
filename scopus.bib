	abstract = {In the global economy, money and assets are essential. Currency market fluctuations significantly impact the global economy, gaining increasing attention worldwide. This study focused on the US dollar as a key currency, gold as a safe asset, and bitcoin as a virtual currency, which all have great value in money and assets. This study aims to model flow fluctuations among the US Dollar, gold, and bitcoin. The research objective is to analyze the interaction effects of the US Dollar, gold, and bitcoin through the volatility modeling. This study utilized two-way ANOVA to analyze the trend of market fluctuations in the US dollars, gold, and bitcoin and whether the fluctuations in their market price affect their interaction with each other using a research model for flow fluctuations. The study examined the market price fluctuation rate of the US dollar, gold, and bitcoin by setting dependent and independent variables for the interaction analysis. The between-subjects test effects revealed that in all three cases, the main effect and the interaction effect of the two variables appear. The points appear irregularly in the profile plots in all three cases, indicating a significant interactive effect. The study’s findings show that the market price fluctuation rates of the US dollar, gold, and bitcoin interact and influence each other, implying the need for further studies on flow fluctuations analysis of the US dollar, gold, and bitcoin to this underexplored concept in global economy trend research. © 2025, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

We find a significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and the digital economy using a matrix approach to the Pearson correlation coefficient. With the help of a minimal spanning tree model and random matrix theory, we can determine the shortest route between assets. Yet, as predicted, only a small percentage of the greatest eigenvalues diverge. We are also developing a novel technique to find the SET-50 index.

	abstract = {Economic and political disorders have multidimensional impacts on all economies around the world. The global world has faced out COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and now the Russian-Ukraine geopolitical crisis. This study investigates the nexus among commodities, crypto, and G20 capital markets along with risk and returns implications. To examine the impact, we applied the TVP-VAR technique suggested by Koop and Korobilis (2014), and Antonakakis, Chatziantoniou, and Gabauer (2020) by adjusting the framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). The research findings reveal that a high level of connectedness was observed during Covid-19, which was persistent for a long period and has multidimensional impacts. More particularly, EU, Canada, France Germany, and the UK were the principal supplier of spillovers to other commodities, Bitcoin, and the remaining markets. During Geopolitical Crisis (here after GPC), conclusively it is observed that of USA, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Mexico, China, Indonesia, and Japan are the net receivers of the volatility spillovers and Russia, Germany, France, European Union, Italy, UK, Argentina, India, Australia, Turkey, Korea, and South Africa are the net transmitters of volatility spillovers. Interestingly, among net transmitters Argentina, South Africa and Turkey are suffered from high inflation and substantial budget deficits, considered as weak economies of G20. Portfolio weights has been increased dramatically during COVID-19 and Russian-Ukraine war. This research could be utilized to take investment, hedging, and diversification decisions about commodities, cryptocurrencies, and stocks, particularly in such turmoil situations with the help of connectedness and various hedging techniques. © 2023 The Authors},

Daily data covering the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods were employed, using the linear and nonlinear Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models. The empirical evidence supports gold as an undisputable diversifier for equity investments in the G7 equity markets under all market conditions. Cryptocurrencies have a valuable safe-haven potential, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, the suitability of the optimal hedge asset depends on market conditions and individual countries, where the traditional assets present the best hedge in the normal conditions, compared to the modern assets. However, in the stress periods, Bitcoin presents the best hedge for the stocks of the G7 European and the UK countries, although Ethereum is the optimal hedge for the U.S. and Canada. In contrast, oil exhibits a superiority in hedging Japanese equities during all market conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

For the analyses, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) and quantile coherency techniques are applied to daily data from February 2020 to March 2023. The results show that Tether Gold and PAX Gold are strong safe havens against the US and equity-valuation-related financial stress but weak safe havens against global financial stress. Tether Gold is a weak safe haven against credit-related financial stress as well. Tether Gold is a strong hedge against US financial stress but a weak hedge against aggregate financial stress of developed economies and that of emerging economies. In our sample, gold-backed cryptocurrencies usually outperform gold and Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven against financial stresses. The Quantile coherency analysis shows that Tether Gold is a hedge against low to moderate financial stress and a safe haven against extreme financial stresses. These findings have important implications for investors, risk-managers and policy makers. © 2023},

	abstract = {The emerging cryptocurrency market is one of the largest financial markets in the world, with a market capitalization that is already surpassing the gross domestic product of many developed economies. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being adopted as a means of transaction and ownership in the digital domain, particularly in areas like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens. Known for its high volatility, this market offers investors the potential for higher returns than traditional financial markets like stocks, foreign exchange, and commodities. However, it remains underexplored in academic research. In this paper, we propose the use of social network analysis to effectively model and analyze the cryptocurrency market and conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore its key properties, including correlation structure, topological characteristics, stability, and influence. Furthermore, we propose the use of centrality measures as novel indicators to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price movement predictions.

The consensus algorithm plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of blockchain systems. The ongoing expansion of the digital economy presents a persistent challenge in identifying or constructing an optimal blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithm that effectively addresses specific business requirements especially for various applications of consumer electronics. This research study introduces a novel approach to enhance blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithms, prioritizing the augmentation of throughput, leader's capacity, and enhancement of fault tolerance. The solution under consideration employs committees established by the Louvain Modularity Optimization (LMO) algorithm for local blockchain, along with reputation-based leader selection, to safeguard the integrity of the blockchain network globally. The proposed approach distributes the transactions among the committees and demonstrates an average throughput that is about 1.6 times greater than that of RapidChain following 100 iterations and 1.14 times more than that of the sharding technique. The results indicate that the utilization of reputation-based leader selection and immediate leader replacement, which is based on reputation score, effectively enhances the resilience of the system against attacks, while simultaneously boosting the overall throughput.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Furthermore, social media has garnered attention for its predictive capabilities in various fields, including financial markets and the economy. In this study, we exploit the predictive power of sentiment from Twitter and Reddit, alongside Google Trends indexes, to forecast log returns for 10 cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Litecoin, Enjin Coin, Horizen, Namecoin, Peercoin and Feathercoin. We evaluate the performance of LASSO Vector Autoregression using daily data from January 2018 to January 2022. In a 30-day recursive forecast, we achieve a mean directional accuracy (MDA) rate of over 50%. Moreover, we observe a significant increase in forecast accuracy in terms of MDA when using sentiment and attention variables as predictors, but only for less capitalized cryptocurrencies. This improvement is not reflected in the RMSE. We also conduct a Granger causality test using post-double LASSO selection for high-dimensional VAR models. Our results suggest that social media sentiment does not Granger-cause cryptocurrencies returns. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The emergence of cryptocurrencies has generated enthusiasm and concern in the modern global economy. However, their high volatility, erratic price fluctuations, and tendency to exhibit price bubbles have made investors cautious about investing in them. Consequently, it is essential to develop methods and models to forecast cryptocurrency returns to benefit investors, traders, and the scientific community. Despite the considerable volume of research on Bitcoin price forecasting, other cryptocurrencies have received little attention in academic literature. Additionally, the current body of literature on predicting cryptocurrency prices or returns emphasizes the use of in-sample methodologies. However, this method is susceptible to overfitting. To address these gaps in the literature, this study employs autoregressive moving average (ARMA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH), and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning neural networks to forecast returns for the ten most actively traded digital currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash, Tether, and Binance Coin. To assess the accuracy of the two models, this study utilizes an out-of-sample method with data gathered sequentially from November 9, 2017, to September 18, 2022. The results indicate that all models exhibit high accuracy, as evidenced by their low root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) values. Meanwhile, the hybrid EGARCH-LSTM or GARCH-LSTM models demonstrate slightly better accuracy compared with the other models. The findings are valuable for investors, traders, and researchers involved in cryptocurrency forecasting. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of spillover effects of energy transition metals in Chile. The study aims at identifying the causal relationships among these energy transition metals and other major assets like oil, gold, and bitcoin, and how they shape Chile's economy, both pre-COVID-19 and during the first months of the pandemic. Our Structural Vector Autoregressive analysis is carried out with daily frequency data for two separate periods, the pre-COVID-19 analysis (the whole of 2018) and the COVID-19 analysis (Feb 2020 to end of 2020). Our results suggest that Chile has been highly responsive to renewable energy shocks during COVID-19, in concert with an increased responsiveness to traditional oil-driven shocks. This lends weight to the idea that traditional energies are still relevant and concomitant with energy transition, especially in a small open resource-oriented economy like Chile. In addition to that, bitcoin shocks seem to have contributed to Chile's transition, likely as a result of bitcoin's extensive use of energy and its potential to increase renewable energy capacity. Policywise, our findings call for a watchful eye on regulatory constraints, excessively high royalties, and the maintenance of stabilization funds to mitigate uncertainty, all of which can affect Chile's competitive edge at an untimely hour. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Bitcoin mining, an energy-intensive process, requires significant amounts of electricity, which results in a particularly high carbon footprint from mining operations. In the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a substantial portion of electricity is generated from coal-fired power plants, the carbon footprint of mining operations is particularly high. This article examines the scale of energy consumption by mining farms, assesses their share in the country’s total electricity consumption, and analyzes the carbon footprint associated with bitcoin mining. A comparative analysis with other sectors of the economy, including transportation and industry is provided, along with possible measures to reduce the environmental impact of mining operations. Materials and methods: To assess the impact of bitcoin mining on the carbon footprint in Kazakhstan, electricity consumption from 2016 to 2023, provided by the Bureau of National Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, was used. Data on electricity production from various types of power plants was also analyzed. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used to analyze the environmental performance of energy systems. CO2 emissions were estimated based on emission factors for various energy sources. Results: The total electricity consumption in Kazakhstan increased from 74,502 GWh in 2016 to 115,067.6 GWh in 2023. The industrial sector’s electricity consumption remained relatively stable over this period. The consumption by mining farms amounted to 10,346 GWh in 2021. A comparative analysis of CO2 emissions showed that bitcoin mining has a higher carbon footprint compared to electricity generation from renewable sources, as well as oil refining and car manufacturing. Conclusions: Bitcoin mining has a significant negative impact on the environment of the Republic of Kazakhstan due to high electricity consumption and resulting carbon dioxide emissions. Measures are needed to transition to sustainable energy sources and improve energy efficiency to reduce the environmental footprint of cryptocurrency mining activities. © 2024 by author(s).},

	abstract = {Fraudulent transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem wield substantial influence over both the economy and the level of trust within a blockchain network. The identification of fraudulent transactions is a crucial task within the financial system. However, existing detection methods predominantly rely on either an individual model or a single bagging or boosting ensemble model, leading to inadequate prediction accuracy and limited interpretability. To address this limitation, a hybrid ensemble model that integrates bagging (random forest (RF)) and boosting (categorical boosting (CatBoost)) is proposed, in which strong classifiers -CatBoost is used to replace the weak classifiers in RF, thus effectively improving the prediction performance. Empirical findings demonstrate the proposed hybrid ensemble framework can consistently yields the highest accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce extreme gradient boosting as a surrogate model that can obtain more accurate relations between actual labels and the predictions, compensating for the challenges of understanding complex models. Then, the visualization package based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) value is adopted for the interpretability analysis on the surrogate model, which contributes to the field of fraud detection by revealing the potential influencing factors behind the predicted results and providing unique insights into how fraud detection behavior can be detected. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy and financial markets. In this article, we explore the impact of the pandemic on the weak-form efficiency of the cryptocurrency and forex markets by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two markets. To estimate the weak-form of market efficiency, we utilize the asymmetric market deficiency measure (MDM) derived using the asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach, along with fuzzy entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Fisher information. Initially, we analyze the temporal evolution of these four measures using overlapping sliding windows. Subsequently, we assess both the mean value and variance of the distribution for each measure and currency in two distinct time periods: before and during the pandemic. Our findings reveal distinct shifts in efficiency before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, there was a clear increase in the weak-form inefficiency of traditional currencies during the pandemic. Among cryptocurrencies, BTC stands out for its behavior, which resembles that of traditional currencies. Moreover, our results underscore the significant impact of COVID-19 on weak-form market efficiency during both upward and downward market movements. These findings could be useful for investors, portfolio managers, and policy makers. © 2023 by the authors.},

Findings: Both gold and cryptocurrencies have limited hedging abilities against macroeconomic shocks across countries. In India, bitcoin has become the new digital gold, while in China, it is not bitcoin but rather gold that retains its hedging abilities. Neither bitcoin nor gold, Binance Coin or Cardano, are found to be the new digital gold in Brazil and Russia.

	abstract = {In the context of the COVID-19's outbreak and its implications for the financial sector, this study analyses the aspect of hedging and safe-haven under the pandemic. Drawing on the daily data from 02 August 2019 to 17 April 2020, our key findings suggest that the contagious effects in financial assets' returns significantly increased under COVID-19, indicating exacerbated market risk. The connectedness spiked in the middle of March, consistent with lockdown timings in major economies. The effect became severe with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic, confirming negative news effects. The return connectedness suggests that COVID-19 has been a catalyst of contagious effects on the financial markets. The crude oil and the government bonds are however not as much affected by the spillovers as their endogenous innovation. In terms of spillovers, we do find the safe-haven function of Gold and Bitcoin. Comparatively, the safe-haven effectiveness of Bitcoin is unstable over the pandemic. Whereas, GOLD is the most promising hedge and safe-haven asset, as it remains robust during the current crisis of COVID-19 and thus exhibits superiority over Bitcoin and Tether. Our findings are useful for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers interested in spillovers and safe havens during the current pandemic. © 2022 The Authors.

Bitcoin, the initial and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, is driving the development of secure and immutable financial payment systems as a challenging innovation. Although digital currencies are unlikely to replace traditional government-issued money, they may have an impact on how global online marketplaces interact with one another by removing the constraints associated with traditional public currency forms and exchange rates. Gold is another commodity which greatly influences the world economy. This research aims to provide a study on hypothetical monetary differences between bitcoin and gold. This article also analyzes the legality of digital currencies and their susceptibility to future government regulations along with investment in Bitcoin and Gold.  © 2024 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.},

	abstract = {The metaverse, a virtual multiuser environment, has garnered global attention for its potential to offer deeply immersive and participatory experiences. As this technology matures, it is evolving in tandem with emerging innovations such as Web 3.0, Blockchain, nonfungible tokens, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which play pivotal roles in the metaverse economy. Robust Bitcoin networks must be modelled for the metaverse environment in Industry 5.0 platforms to ensure the metaverse’s sustained growth and relevance. Industry 5.0 is poised to experience significant economic expansion, driven in large part by the transformative influence of metaverse technology. Researchers have actively explored diverse strategies and approaches to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by current Bitcoin networks, highlighting the limitless potential for enhancing anonymity and privacy while navigating this exciting digital frontier. By addressing the diverse anonymity and privacy evaluation attributes, the lack of clarity regarding the prioritisation of these attributes and the variability in data, this modelling approach can be categorised as a form of multiple attribute decision-making (MADM). This review seeks to achieve three main objectives: firstly, to identify research gaps, obstacles, and problems within scholarly literature, which is crucial for assessing and modelling Bitcoin networks to succour the metaverse environment of Industry 5.0; secondly, to pinpoint theoretical gaps, proposed solutions, and benchmarking of Bitcoin networks; and thirdly, to offer an overview of the existing validation and evaluation methods employed in the literature. This review introduced a unique taxonomy by intersecting “Bitcoin networks based on blockchain aspects” with “anonymity and privacy development attributes aspect.” It emphasised the study’s significance and innovation. The results illustrate that employing MADM techniques is highly suitable for modelling Bitcoin networks to support the metaverse within the context of Industry 5.0. This thorough review is an invaluable resource for academics and decision-makers, offering perspectives regarding the improvements, applications, and potential directions for evaluating Bitcoin networks to bolster the metaverse environment of Industry 5.0. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

However, these are foreign to the P2P spirit of trusted interactions and transactions. This paper aims to identify solutions that align with P2P technologies and relationships to combat the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. In line with our research question, we adopt the method of grounded theory. Based on 45 interviews on 1,500 h of podcasts, blogs, and TV shows, we observed how experts in finance, technology, and cryptocurrency analyzed the hazards, as well as, the solutions for cryptocurrencies schemes. The results indicate that this new technology has also engendered new types of criminal schemes; thus, we can categorize malicious behaviors into conventional and P2P hazards. In addition, experts also point to conventional and P2P solutions to crypto-crimes at the individual, organizational, communal, and national levels. As such, they underscore the discrepancies between those who push for solutions favoring conventional regulatory forces versus those advocating for normative legitimacy, hence pulling the industry to preserve the P2P identity. Following institutional theory and the need for legitimacy in this new and disruptive industry, we discuss the tension between agendas and suggest unorthodox solutions for an innovative yet troubled technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

However, unlike credit cards and other well-established digital payment services and solutions, digital currencies bring new and complex challenges for the economies, including legal and regulatory implications. Private cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have impacted the financial system primarily as a speculative trading instrument. However, with the emergence of central bank digital currencies, digital money has the potential to revolutionise the payment system, since its features can assure the stability needed for a transactional currency. In this context, tax administrations will be affected both on policy and operational aspects.

	abstract = {Based on traditional market theory, this study aims to investigate whether conventional market investment slopes affect the unconventional Bitcoin market, considering both normal conditions and crises. This study examines three main characteristics of the economy-intensive blockchain system, namely reliability, investment slopes, financial and accounting aspects that ultimately determine the confidence in the choice to invest in cryptocurrency. The analysis focuses on the study of the Bitcoin (BTC) investment slopes during January 2014–April 2023, considering the specifics of blockchain technology and the inferences of ethics, reliability and real-world data on investment Tassets in the context of conventional regulated markets. Using an econometric model that incorporates reliability analysis techniques, factorial comparisons and multinomial regression using economic crisis periods as a dummy variable, this study reveals important findings for practical and academic purposes. The results of this study show that the investment slopes of Bitcoin (BTC) are mostly predictable for downward trends, when statistically significant correlations with the investment slopes of conventional stock markets are observable. The moderate or high increase in performance slopes pose several challenges for predictive analysis, as they are influenced by other factors than conventional regulated market performance inferences. The results of this study are of intense interest to researchers and investors alike, as they demonstrate that investment slopes analysis sheds light on the intricacies of investment decisions, allowing a comprehensive assessment of both conventional markets and Bitcoin transactions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has a huge impact on our digital society by enabling a more decentralized economy and policy making. This decentralization is also pivotal in payment Payment channel networks (PCNs), including the Lightning Network, have emerged as a promising solution to the scalability challenges that many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, grapple with. These PCNs, while innovative, also inherit the rigorous dependability demands of the blockchain. A pivotal aspect of this dependability is the need for a high degree of decentralization, essential for mitigating liquidity bottlenecks and on-path attacks. Driven by this imperative, our research embarks on an empirical centrality analysis of the Lightning Network, with a keen focus on the betweenness centrality distribution of its routing system. Utilizing an extensive dataset, sourced from several millions of broadcasted messages via the gossip protocol, we introduce the TimeMachine tool, an innovative method that allows for a temporal exploration of the network's evolution. Our findings reveal that while the Lightning Network exhibits a commendable level of decentralization, there is a discernible skew: a limited set of nodes command a significant portion of the transactions. Alarmingly, over the past two years, the network's centrality has surged, with the inequality, as gauged by the Gini index, rising by over 15 uptick of approximately 5 in. This research not only uncovers critical insights into the Lightning Network's structural dynamics but also raises the question about strategies and policies that ensure its sustained decentralization in the face of evolving challenges such as security vulnerabilities, potential monopolistic tendencies, liquidity bottlenecks, the risk of transaction censorship and many more. © 2023 The Authors},

Circles was born out of the Gnosis Chain as a more democratic alternative to Bitcoin coupled with the ambitious political project of algorithmically distributing UBI. Backed by the Gnosis Chain, Circles Coop was founded in 2020 to implement this idea in Berlin. Examining the failure of the Berlin pilot helps us draw substantial conclusions with regard to the implementation of UBI on blockchain. UBI alone, on blockchain or not, is not enough to solve the problems its proponents argue against. UBI would be helpful as a tool if plugged into a model of production embedded into a political strategy aiming to fix key problems of current societies such as gaping inequalities and climate change. We give a snapshot here of the model of open cooperativism as a counter-hegemonic political project vis-à-vis neoliberalism. Circles UBI could plug into the model of open cooperativism as a distribution and liquidity injection mechanism to foster the transition towards a commons-based ethical and sustainable post-capitalist economy.

In an effort of interdisciplinary integration, combining human geography with political economy and cultural anthropology, we critically assess the linkages between cryptocurrency, economic crisis and forms of political and economic precarity and exploitation. Drawing on experiences in Latin America, mostly on the cases of El Salvador and Venezuela, we explore how cryptocurrencies have rapidly emerged and expanded during periods of economic and political crises. We ground this discussion on social theories of money and critical analysis of blockchain and cryptocurrencies that question the apolitical assumptions of these apparent “trustless” infrastructures. The article contends that cryptocurrencies have the capacity to create potential niches for makeshift economic survival, speculation and quick profit, while at the same time reproducing historical conditions of vulnerability, inequality and ‘crypto-colonialism’. Though cryptocurrencies are surrounded by stories of freedom and decentralised community control, our ethnographic data on El Salvador and Venezuela suggest they often rely on free market fundamentalism and conditions of political corruption by authoritarian state-backed elites. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {From the launch of Bitcoin till the present moment, cryptocurrency market had expanded continuously, gaining more and more influence over the global economy with each passing year. Yet, the events of 2020 marked a new phase for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which has experienced a significant increase in size and complexity. The third halving cycle that led to an increase in cryptocurrency prices, the beginning of pandemic, and afterward inflation and economic uncertainty made Bitcoin an attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. Although the liquidity of the cryptocurrency assets increased, their volatile nature is still persistent, causing mixed views on its status. While crypto-enthusiasts are perceiving it as a worthwhile investment with novel economic properties, the more skeptic participants consider it only a speculative asset with a transitory presence. The absence of a consensus on this topic has attracted the interest of the academic community, which aims to analyze whether cryptocurrencies display economic properties. A keystone characteristic for considering cryptocurrency an economic asset is the lack of price manipulation. In this respect, numerous papers have investigated the efficiency of the cryptocurrency market. Even though the results are mixed, a large body of studies indicate that the efficiency of the crypto-assets market varies, increasing from period to period. However, most of the papers focus on testing information efficiency only on the spot market. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze whether the futures cryptocurrency market is efficient. In this regard, the futures prices for Bitcoin from 2018 to 2022 are used. On them, a battery of tests is applied, which investigate several statistical properties that can assess the efficiency hypothesis. Furthermore, under the assumption of efficient market hypothesis the spot and future prices are supposed to move together. In the contrary case, the efficient market hypothesis is rejected. Thus, the property is evaluated from a double perspective by using statistical tests and evaluating the relation between the spot and the future price. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {This study investigates volatility spillovers and network connectedness among four cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and BNB coin), four energy companies (Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Nextera Energy), and four mega-technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) in the US. We analyze data for the period November 15, 2017–October 28, 2022 using methodologies in Diebold and Yilmaz (Int J Forecast 28(1):57–66, 2012) and Baruník and Křehlík (J Financ Economet 16(2):271–296 2018). Our analysis shows the COVID-19 pandemic amplified volatility spillovers, thereby intensifying the impact of financial contagion between markets. This finding indicates the impact of the pandemic on the US economy heightened risk transmission across markets. Moreover, we show that Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, Apple, and Microsoft are net volatility transmitters, while Tether, BNB, Exxon Mobil, Nextera Energy, Alphabet, and Amazon are net receivers Our results suggest that short-term volatility spillovers outweigh medium- and long-term spillovers, and that investors should be more concerned about short-term repercussions because they do not have enough time to act quickly to protect themselves from market risks when the US market is affected. Furthermore, in contrast to short-term dynamics, longer term patterns display superior hedging efficiency. The net-pairwise directional spillovers show that Alphabet and Amazon are the highest shock transmitters to other companies. The findings in this study have implications for both investors and policymakers. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the connectedness between bitcoin (BTC) and other traditional assets (e.g. metals) in times of financial turbulence like the COVID pandemic. The purpose is to see to what extent BTC is mimicking the role precious metals are known for, that of being a reliable store of value. Design/methodology/approach: The author relies on vector autoregressive modeling, as it yields a very flexible framework for forecasting and interpreting the interdependencies among variables, while providing a very intuitive framework when the underlying structural model is unknown. The author performs the analysis first for the whole sample and then for a “COVID-19 subsample.” Findings: The author finds evidence supporting a stronger link between BTC and gold in COVID-19 times, with BTC the main driving force. The author quantifies the contribution of BTC to the surge in gold’s price during those early months of COVID-19 in the order of 28%, thus lending support to the idea of intrinsic or fundamental value in BTC. Practical implications: Investors might consider including BTC in their portfolios as a long-term investment, very much like they do with gold. Social implications: Cryptos at large represent an important check on the ever-expanding monetary policy pursued by central banks in recent times. Originality/value: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on the world economy. It is thus timely to reevaluate the relationship between BTC and other assets such as gold and silver, which are traditionally seen as safe havens against uncertainty. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The authors argue that current behavioral prediction models, such as TRA, TPB, and TAM, do not adequately account for the affective constructs of decision-making when high monetary stakes are involved. To address this gap, the authors propose an integrative model that accounts for financial decision-making processes, risk constructs, and population-specific behavioral strategies. The study used a quantitative-based research design and involved 684 university students from one of the major state universities in the Philippines. The findings show that perceived usefulness, attitude toward cryptocurrency, self-efficacy, and descriptive norms significantly influenced the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Overall, the study confirms the direct influence of instrumental attitude, knowledge of cryptocurrency, descriptive norm, risk tolerance, ease and difficulty, and control on an individual’s intention to use cryptocurrency. The study contributes to exploring a less studied Philippine consumer base and provides empirical findings and insights into Bitcoin adoption in developing Asian economies. JEL Classification: G15.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the conditional volatility of the Asian stock market concerning Bitcoin and global crude oil price movement. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the newest Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to examine the conditional volatility of the stock market for Bitcoin and crude oil prices in the Asian perspective. The sample stock market includes Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Malaysian, Pakistani, Singaporean, South Korean and Turkish stock exchanges, with daily time series data ranging from 4 April 2015−31 July 2023. Findings: The outcome reveals the presence of volatility clustering on the return series of crude oil, Bitcoin and all selected stock exchanges of the current study. Secondly, the outcome of DCC, manifests that there is no short-run volatility spillover from crude oil to the Malaysian, Pakistani and South Korean and Turkish stock markets, whereas Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Singapore stock exchanges show the short-run volatility spillover from crude oil in the short run. On the other hand, in the long run, there is a volatility spillover effect from crude oil to all the stock exchanges. Thirdly, the findings suggest that there is no immediate spillover of volatility from Bitcoin to the stock markets return volatility of China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and Singapore. In contrast, both the Japanese and Turkish stock exchanges exhibit a short-term volatility spillover from Bitcoin. In the long term, a volatility spillover effect from Bitcoin is observed in all stock exchanges except for Malaysia. Lastly, based on the outcome of conditional variance, it can be concluded that there was increase in the return volatility of stock exchanges during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The analysis below does not account for the bias induced due to certain small sample properties of DCC-GARCH model. There exists a huge literature that suggests other methodologies for small sample corrections such as the DCC connectedness approach. On the other hand, decisive corollaries of the conclusions drawn above have been made purely based on a comprehensive investigation of eight Asian stock exchange economies. However, there is scope for inclusive examination by considering other Nordic and Western financial markets with panel data approach to get more robust inferences about the reality. Originality/value: Most of the empirical analysis in this perspective skewed towards the Nordic and Western countries. In addition to that many empirical investigations examine either the impact of crude oil price movement or Bitcoin performance on the stock market return volatility. However, none of the examinations quests the crude oil and Bitcoin together to unearth their implication on the stock market return volatility in a single study, especially in the Asian context. Hence, current investigation endeavours to examine the ramifications of Bitcoin and crude oil price movement on the stock market return volatility from an Asian perspective, which has significant implications for the investors of the Asian financial market. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Distributed currencies suffer from extreme volatility, and this can lead to catastrophic implications during future economic crisis. Understanding the dynamics of this new type of currencies is vital for empowering supervisory bodies to behave proactively as well-informed planners rather than reactively as incident responders. Bitcoin, the first and dominant distributed cryptocurrency, is still notoriously vague, especially for a financial instrument with market value exceeding $1 trillion. Modeling the Bitcoin Overlay Network poses a number of important theoretical and methodological challenges. This drastically undermines the ability to predict key features such as network’s resilience.

	abstract = {In recent years, cryptocurrency has attracted more attention and is a new option in the economy and the financial sector. The purpose of this study is to the volatility and ”herd behavior” of the cryptocurrency, gold, and stock markets in the US. This research is aimed at investor ”herd behavior” and how it correlates with the volatility of three assets: the Standard & Poor’s 500 indexes, Bitcoin, and gold. Also, A new formula by applying the conditional standard deviation (risk), maximum return, minimum return, and average return to quantify the herding bias is designed in this research. In this study, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (GARCH) and the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) were both employed. Research results show that Bitcoin is 3.3 times as volatile as the S&P 500 and 4.6 times as volatile as gold. The results of this novel equation also show that the herding bias of Bitcoin is more than 26 times higher than the global average and 10 times higher than the S&P 500. Also, it’s important to consider the energy consumption and sustainability of investments when evaluating their long-term viability and risk. In some cases, investments in companies with strong sustainability practices and low carbon footprints may be seen as lower risk. Since Bitcoin relies on a network of computers to validate transactions based on proof of work and it is an energy consumption consensus mechanism, investment in Bitcoin may be seen as a higher risk. © 2023, Allameh Tabataba'i University.

This paper illuminates the complex geographies of one such firm, Bitfury Group, to investigate the global and national forms and structures such companies take and the factors encouraging them to concentrate operations in certain areas. To investigate the latter, we adopt the case study of Bitfury’s operations in Georgia, a South-Caucasian country where its presence is significant. We adapt Haberly et al.’s analytical framework to explore Bitfury’s geographical dimensions. We highlight how cheap electricity, regulatory and taxation regimes, personal encounters and personalities, and the materialities of hardware and energy-saving technology define these geographies and illuminate how Bitfury actively curates advantageous regulatory spaces. We encourage future work exploring Blockchain and Bitcoin technologies to understand the companies involved as simultaneously material and virtual, and as centrepieces in global networks interweaving production and finance. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between Bitcoin returns, the consumer price index, and economic policy uncertainty. Employing the QARDL method, this study examines both short- and long-term dynamics between macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin returns. Our analysis of monthly time series data from January 2011 to November 2023 reveals that volatile US economic policy indicators, such as high economic policy uncertainty, volatile inflation, and rising interest rates, have recently exerted a negative impact on Bitcoin returns. This study shows that these results are true not only for traditional money but also for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, despite their cardinal features. Its decentralized nature, indicating that it has no physical representation, is not tied to any authority or national economy and relies on a complex algorithm to track transactions. Further, it yields volatile returns that depend on macroeconomic indicators. © 2024 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: We employed the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a comprehensive survey with 300 responses, and quantitative analysis using SmartPLS from December 2022 to March 2023. Findings: The findings reveal that the perceived usefulness of the Bitcoin market, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and herd behavior positively impact the Bitcoin investment decisions of individual investors in Vietnam. Research, Practical & Social Implications: This study provides regulators and relevant agencies with more practical evidence regarding the Bitcoin market, facilitating the formulation of appropriate management policies in an emerging economy. Originality/value: There is a shortage of research on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency investment market from the perspective of individual investors in emerging countries like Vietnam. Therefore, this study tries to shed light on individual investors with a comprehensive and objective overview to consider before making investment decisions. Additionally, the results can offer managers and relevant agencies empirical evidence to promulgate future regulations on the Bitcoin market. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Although historically designed as parallel computing accelerators for image rendering and videogames, graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in the explosion of both cryptoasset mining and machine learning models. The political economy associated with video games and Bitcoin and Ethereum mining provided a staggering growth in performance and energy efficiency and this, in turn, fostered a change in the epistemological understanding of AI: from rules-based or symbolic AI towards the matrix multiplications underpinning connectionism, machine learning and neural nets. Combining a material political economy of markets with a material epistemology of science, the article shows that there is no clear-cut division between software and hardware, between instructions and tools, and between frameworks of thought and the material and economic conditions of possibility of thought itself. As the microchip shortage and the growing geopolitical relevance of the hardware and semiconductor supply chain come to the fore, the paper invites social scientists to engage more closely with the materialities and hardware architectures of ‘virtual’ algorithms and software. © The Author(s) 2023.},

We develop a hybrid deep learning model based on feature selection in different frequency domains to enrich the literature of Bitcoin price prediction. Indicators such as Technology, Economy, Green Finance and Media Attention are considered. We first decompose all the data into different frequencies through CEEMDAN approach, and then the data at the same frequency are integrated into a Random Forest model to reduce the subset of potential predictors by measuring the importance of different factors. Finally, the selected factors are put into the LSTM/GRU to make the prediction of different components of Bitcoin prices at the same frequency, and aggregate together to obtain the predicted Bitcoin prices. The empirical results show that our proposed model outperforms the benchmark models, which is verified by MCS test. The proposed hybrid method obtains much higher return on investment in simulated trading than other benchmark models. Our study inspired the investors to accurately predict Bitcoin price and dig possible relationships between different assets and its determinants in frequency domain. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Using the wavelet multiscale coherence technique, the paper examines the interdependences between global market assets, sovereign credit default swap (CDS) and yield-to-maturity on bond spread for African economies from January 2019 to March 2023. The empirical results primarily reveal a high level of coherence between global market assets and Africa's sovereign CDS and yield-to-maturity, although varying across countries and time-frequency domain. Notably, the high degree of coherence and the positive co-movement between sovereign CDS and global market assets are more concentrated at the medium and upper frequency bands. The observed intensity of co-movements between global market assets and sovereign CDS/yield-to-maturity (YTM) of bond spread, with global market assets broadly serving as leading variables, suggests that an increased global investor's risk aversion positively affects the yields on Africa market bonds. Among the global market assets, we identified that VIX (which is implied volatility of S&P500) has the dominant influence on Africa sovereign CDS/YTM compared to that emanating from Bitcoin and Godman Sachs Commodity Index. This is highly conceivable as VIX gauges bubbling global risks and uncertainties which considerably influences investor's risk aversion. The heterogeneous lead/lag dynamics also provide useful information to global investors, including by utilizing African markets to rebalance their portfolios for risk management purposes. The empirical findings thus provide further critical information to investors for hedging purposes, and to policymakers in formulating sovereign risk management policies oriented towards minimizing sovereign default risks. © 2024 The Authors},

The studies that have discussed social media analytics and digital economy on a global scale using bibliometric analysis are very less in numbers. Therefore, this study determines the trends and maps in the digital economy and social media analytics using VOSviewer. The present study analyses 1539 articles collected from the Scopus database and uses VOSviewer that creates a visual representation of the data. Analyses of co-occurrence of keywords, co-citation, journals, and co-authorship have been employed in the study. The findings of the study reveal the most prominent trends in terms of influence, most prolific journals, articles, authors, topics, keywords, and countries. Content analysis has been employed using the bibliographic coupling of documents to identify the broad themes of the clusters. Further, a conceptual quadrant model has been devised to examine the outcomes of the interrelation between social media analytics and digital economy. This study further reveals that research on digital economy and social media analytics has shifted from the developed world to the developing nations. Now, more and more research is being conducted in the countries like China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine and India. Through the density visualization of keywords analysis, it is revealed that keywords like “digitalization”, “artificial intelligence”, “blockchain”, “cryptocurrency”, and “bitcoin” are in trends of research in the subject matter. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Being deplatformed on Youtube results in a 30% increase in weekly Bitcoin revenue and a 50% increase in viewership on Bitchute.

Building upon the Polanyian notion of double movement and the international financial subordination research program, I contend that the ideology of the governing party and the strength of popular mobilization still contribute to policy variegation in capital flow management even at the bottom of the global currency hierarchy. The case studies on Ecuador and El Salvador since the late 2000s provide support for this argument. In both countries, administrations led by post-neoliberal left-wing parties tightened capital flow management, while their right-wing successors gave a new impulse to capital mobility. However, these regulatory cycles varied according to the strength of popular pressures. In Ecuador, where social movements had a strong mobilizational capacity, post-neoliberal governments deployed encompassing capital controls, while their right-wing successor had to follow a gradualist approach in their liberalizing agenda. In El Salvador, on the other hand, given the relative weakness of the bottom-up pressure, post-neoliberal administrations pursued a targeted macroprudential approach, while the right-wing successor faced little resistance to implementing a radical neoliberal agenda that included even the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender alongside the United States dollar. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {By the end of 2021, the worldwide cryptocurrency market valuation had hit a whole high of $3 trillion. Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The adoption of blockchain, as well as the technology and products it enables, will continue to have a significant influence on company operations. However, blockchain technology is much more than a secure cryptocurrency transfer method. It may be utilised in areas other than finance, including as healthcare, insurance, voting, welfare benefits, gaming and artist royalties. The global economy is prepared for the blockchain revolution, with the technology already having an influence on business and society on many levels. If the term "revolution"seems extreme, consider that eight of the world's ten largest corporations are developing a variety of blockchain-based solutions. Any enterprise or organisation that is engaged in the recording and oversight of any type of transaction stands to profit from shifting its operations to a blockchain-based platform. This paper discusses about the various roles blockchain has taken up over the years in several different industries along with the future opportunities and scope of expansion to numerous other professional sectors. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

	abstract = {In the digital economy, the emergence of digital currencies has attracted considerable attention from both investors and researchers. However, their high volatility characteristics present new challenges in investment decision-making and risk assessment. To capture the characteristics comprehensively, this paper proposes a novel approach for constructing confidence regions for interval-valued variables based on the exponentially decay weighted bootstrap. The coverage area of the confidence regions and tail quantiles provide new indicators for assessing the volatility and tail risks in the market. Empirical results using Bitcoin as a case study demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms other traditional point-based methods such as exponential weighted moving average in measuring the uncertainty and intraday price volatility. Furthermore, the derived tail quantiles exhibit superior predictive performance for tail risk compared to Value-at-risk methods and the exponential weighted moving average, as evidenced by various tests. The proposed methodology not only contributes a new statistical tool for analyzing digital currency volatility but also provides novel perspectives for extreme risk management in financial markets. © 2024 Science China Press.

	abstract = {From the perspectives of asset pricing, market outreach, regulatory framework, and investor ethos, crypto markets differ substantially from traditional financial markets. Given these fundamental differences, it is interesting to examine how the notions of market efficiency apply to crypto markets, especially because the arguments of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970) and the adaptive market hypothesis (Lo, 2004, and Lo, 2008) were originally developed in the context of traditional financial markets. Research on the informational efficiency of crypto markets has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper examines the evolving efficiency of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, especially during the period when economies around the world were devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For a newly-emerged cryptocurrency with a market that is essentially global, a global shock like the COVID-19 pandemic presents ideal conditions for assessing how efficiency evolves as the market faces a series of shocks. Employing a fixed-length rolling window approach, this paper carries out the following tests: the automatic portmanteau test of Escanciano and Lobato (2009), the wild bootstrap automatic variance ratio test proposed by Kim (2009), the generalized spectral test of Escaciano and Valesco (2006), and the test proposed by Dominguez and Lobato (2003). The results provide evidence of episodes of inefficiency in a market that is efficient over extended periods. The inefficiency index constructed in this study shows that the Bitcoin market went through proportionately longer and more frequent episodes of inefficiency during the COVID-19 period. This is in line with the adaptive market hypothesis and has practical significance for investors and regulators. © 2024, Pro Global Science Association. All rights reserved.},

Results: The key prerequisites for the application of effective regulatory approaches to transactions with crypto currencies and directions for building the legislative and regulatory framework for such transactions in Ukraine are presented. Conclusion: It is established that: virtual currency is different from fiat currency; virtual currency differs from electronic money, because electronic money is always real currency with the status of legal tender and does not change the unit of account, but stores it in electronic form; virtual currency is a subcategory of digital currency. It is established that: that the development of the legal status of virtual currency should take into account the peculiarities of social relations related to its "life activity". The norms that regulate the legal status of virtual currency and the specifics of its circulation in the economy of Ukraine should be established at the legislative level. © 2024, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the diversification, hedging, and safe-haven capabilities of Bitcoin and gold against blue economy and green finance assets using three different MGARCH models (DCC, ADCC, and GO-GARCH) during adverse events such as the COVID-19 health crisis and the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Blue economy assets, which refer to sectors that sustainably utilize ocean resources, are a key focus alongside green finance assets. The findings reveal that during crises, Bitcoin demonstrates robust safe-haven characteristics, particularly against blue economy assets like BJLE and OCEN. Conversely, gold exhibits pronounced safe-haven properties against specific blue economy and green finance assets such as BJLE and FAN. The GO-GARCH model highlights gold’s strong diversification and safe-haven roles, especially against BJLE. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is more effective as a diversifier for PIO. Moreover, the GO-GARCH model consistently outperforms the DCC and ADCC models in terms of hedging effectiveness, showing that gold is the preferred hedging instrument for GNR and TAN, while Bitcoin is more effective for other blue and green assets. The results underscore the distinct roles of Bitcoin and gold in portfolio management strategies, offering insights for investors navigating market uncertainties in the context of sustainable investments. © 2025 Manzli et al.

	abstract = {Since the proposal of Bitcoin, the world witnessed a mass confusion in official reports and decrees that were subjectively not useful nor justifiable for users. This observation basically stems from several factors, including limited technical knowledge, and/or fear of change that is related to the psychology of the decision maker. Also, there had been an obvious disagreement on the definition of common economical concepts between conventional (centralized) and unconventional (decentralized) systems. This, in turn, resulted in great difficulty in making comprehensive decisions and complete official decrees regarding different cryptocurrency systems. Furthermore, many of these official decrees neglected basic ruling principles, such as individual innocuous freedom, and proper differentiation between applications that look similar but behave differently. This paper aims to address such issues by providing the necessary technical details for non-practitioners on cryptocurrencies. We propose guidelines for characterizing the required level of comprehensiveness in this regards, that will help decision makers prepare well defined official decrees. The use of a common legalization methodology will enable reliable analysis and comparison of governmental/organizational strategies and protocols, which is necessary for the improvement of economies. Our main contribution is a framework for generating optimally unbiased decrees about a given (type of) cryptocurrency. We achieve our goal by outlining similarities and differences between conventional and unconventional economic systems, and analyzing cases of incomplete decrees. © 2024 IEEE.},

Cryptocurrencies are digital representations of valuable intangibles utilised in a variety of online applications and networks, from social media and online gaming to virtual economies and peer-to-peer systems. In recent years, virtual currency’s adoption has skyrocketed across a wide range of platforms. Cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital currency that uses an encrypted peer-to-peer network to facilitate digital trade. In its role as a disruptive technology, Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, is challenging the status quo of traditional financial payment methods that have remained mostly unchanged for decades. Even though cryptocurrencies aren’t going to replace fiat currency anytime soon, they have the potential to alter the way in which Internet-enabled global markets interact with one another by removing the restrictions surrounding standard national currencies and exchange rates. This article delves at the wide-ranging effects of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on current banking structures and the possible disruptions they could cause in the future. To better comprehend the economic ramifications of cryptocurrencies and block chain technology and how they can affect future economic systems, this study is a great resource for policymakers, financial professionals, and academics. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {The pandemic has exacerbated the effects of the digital transformation: the extractive economy is steadily giving way to the new economic space—the digital economy. This transformation shakes the very foundations of the existence and purpose of law, i.e., the regulation of social relations. However, today, the consequences of developing tech in an unsustainable manner are becoming obvious. Despite the internet’s many benefits, it also erodes trust and fuels misinformation, polarization, and inequality. These developments occur partly because the algorithms that shape our economies, society, and even public discourse were developed with few legal restrictions or commonly held ethical standards. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the technologies that currently shape our socio-economic relations must be consistent with both our shared norms and values and the existing rules. The main question of this study is how to correctly introduce tech that is legal by design, but also, and especially, liable and sustainable by design. The underlying questions are hence, firstly: to this end, do we need (to create) a whole new body of norms, law, and regulation? Alternatively, are there already legal fields, concepts, and tools that can help us lay comprehensive groundwork for tech that is liable and sustainable by design? The central object of this study is to address this problem with regard to the types of organization that is in any way involved in or at least related to tech and innovation, essentially, the Web 3-4 actors. My principal method is systems analysis, which engages with a system as a whole. The construct of regulatory compliant and sustainable tech is thus analysed both functionally and institutionally, with concepts including norm-setting and law-making, formal application and enforcement, case law, real-world effects, and limitations. The objective of the article is to first synthesize the pre-existing legal and regulatory fields and constructs, and then analyse in a succinct yet systematic manner the conditions for their applicability to, and efficiency for, regulation of Web 3.0 (and soon, Web 4.0), as well as their limits. In the course of the study, I found that there are a few pre-existing legal fields, concepts, and tools that can pave the way to creating a Web that is liable and sustainable by design. I have also identified two key developments that arise from the digital transformation: (i) the digital economic space creates the so-called governance and regulatory gaps; and (ii) some of these gaps are rapidly filled (at times, successfully and at times, less so) by a burgeoning newest legal framework (national and supranational targeted regulation, legislation, and case law), which has been growing especially rapidly since the global digital ‘leap’ facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the beginning of the 2020s. To conclude, the article summarizes both pre-existing and new tools and thus offers a ready-to-use toolkit for a regulatory compliant and sustainable tech (including a table summarizing the toolkit), which is the key aim of this paper. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {Interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology has increased significantly in recent years, especially among investors who view Bitcoin as an alternative asset. This study aims to test the relationship between technology acceptance factors and investment decisions in Bitcoin of Thai investors focus the southern region of Thailand. This is a quantitative research study conducted through a survey of 400 Bitcoin investors, sampled primarily through online social networks using a closed-ended questionnaire. The study examines five technology acceptance factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived risk, social influence, and facilitating conditions that may affect investment decisions in Bitcoin. The study found that the sample group had a high level of acceptance of Bitcoin in all areas and had a significant correlation with investment decisions in Bitcoin overall, which is statistically significant at 0.05. However, when considering the influence of technology acceptance factors that affect investment decisions in Bitcoin, it was found that there were 4 statistically significant factors at the 0.05 level of significance, including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived risk, and facilitating conditions. Among these factors, the performance expectancy had the most effect on investment decisions in Bitcoin among investors in the southern region of Thailand. These study results reflect the confidence of investors in the southern region of Thailand in investing in Bitcoin, and it is an opportunity for both the public and private sectors to collaborate to promote the development of digital currencies systems in Thailand to become the center of the digital asset economy system in the region. © (2024), (Greater Mekong Subregion Academic and Research Network).

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to assess the dynamic volatility connectedness between fossil energy, clean energy, and major assets i.e., Bonds, Bitcoin, Dollar index, Gold, and Standard and Poor's 500 from September 17, 2014 to October 11, 2022. The main motivation of the study relates to examining the dynamic volatility connectedness mentioned during periods of important events such as the recent coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict which has shown the vulnerability of economic and financial assets, energy commodities, and clean energy. The novel Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) approach is employed for the investigation of the sample period mentioned. Empirical analysis reveals that both the total and net volatility connectedness between assets is time-varying. The highest connectedness among the assets is observed with the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and it increases with some important international events, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict, the referendum of Brexit, China–US trade war, and Brexit day. On average, the result shows that 32.8% of the volatility in one asset spills over to all other assets. The DCC-GARCH results also indicate that crude oil, bonds, and Bitcoin act as almost pure volatility transmitters, whereas the Dollar index, gold, and S&P500 act as volatility receivers. On the other hand, clean energy is found neutral to external shocks until the first quarter of 2020 and after that time, it starts to behave as a volatility transmitter. Based on the obtained results, we offer some specific policy implications that are beneficial to the US economy and other countries.

	abstract = {Money laundering is the process of legitimizing funds obtained through illegal activities. It significantly impacts the global economy and fosters various criminal activities (e.g., terrorism, drug smuggling, or human trafficking). Existing money laundering detection methods face performance and robustness challenges due to low data quality and scarce labels. This paper proposes the CA-ES framework (Contrastive Pre-Trained Transformer Encoder with Context Aggregation and Enhancement Strategy). The framework employs self-supervised contrastive learning techniques to pre-train the Transformer Encoder, enabling the model to learn high-quality representations of samples without requiring labels. Specifically, we propose the Node-Subgraph-Node method, which adequately expresses the context information of each node. Additionally, we design a context aggregation and an enhancement strategy to fully mine graph knowledge, thereby generating high-quality representations that are beneficial to money laundering detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to apply the Contrastive Pre-Trained Transformer Encoder to anti-money laundering. Evaluation on two real Bitcoin transaction datasets shows that our proposed method outperforms seven baseline methods on multiple evaluation metrics. Under the Elliptic dataset, our money laundering detection method achieves Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-Score of 0.967, 0.875, 0.919, and 0.936, respectively. Compared to the best baseline method, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-Score improved by 15.4%, 9.1%, and 2.0%, respectively.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {The development of modern information technologies and the processes of globalization are key factors for the emergence and spread of virtual currency. The legal status of cryptocurrency is still uncertain. It is considered both as a modern means of payment and as a speculative tool for illegal activities. However, despite such diametrically opposed interpretations, the fact that economic realities are constantly changing is unconditional. The IFRS reporting system is no exception, which should adapt to new challenges in a timely manner and take into account the need to disclose information about new progressive elements as much as possible. The article aims to analyze the economic and financial essence of cryptocurrencies, assess the phenomenon of the crypto economy and its impact on the financial market and monetary policy, as well as to outline appropriate implications for the corporate level – namely, for management accounting. The methodology is based on a theoretical analysis of cryptographic protocols and tools for investment and macroeconomic analysis, some approaches of economic theory. It is shown that although today cryptocurrency is a speculative, high-risk instrument, cryptoeconomics is increasingly integrating into the global financial market, while the potential risks of this process still outweigh its benefits. Accordingly, at the micro-level, management accountants must understand the related risks and be able to explain the implications to the management team and the board of directors. The originality of research consists of an attempt to combine the analysis of macro- and micro-implications of emerging crypto economics based on an economic theory foundation. © 2024 AESSRA.

In particular, for short-term horizons, Bitcoin shows favorably low correlation with each index for all years, whereas exception is observed for gold. In addition, diversification between Bitcoin and gold is demonstrated as well, mainly for short-term investments. However, the diversification benefit is conditional for both Bitcoin and gold under the recent pandemic and war crises.

Moreover, impact of gold mining, extraction on Blue-Green economy and even relationship with cryptocurrency is another interesting facet. Therefore, we delved into the interconnectedness among five indices, two of which focus on the green economy (ICLN-iShares and CNRG-SandP), whereas three are on the blue economy (BJLE-BNP Paribas ESG Blue Economy ETF and PIO-Invesco Global Water ETF) and OCEN (IQ Clean Oceans ETF) alongside the traditional assets Bitcoin and gold indices. We considered between October 26, 2021, to January 5, 2024 for the study. This study highlighted some cardinal findings. First, BJLE can be used as a hedge against OCEN and PIO (all are in Blue economy). Second, excessive water usage in Bitcoin mining is detrimental to Blue-Green economy. Third, positive policy shock force spillover effect to cool down. Fourth, spillover typically increases as both economic uncertainty (US Banks collapse in 2023) and geopolitical risk (Russia-Ukraine conflict) increase. Fifth, there has been an increased responsiveness of these markets to immediate events (near-term bias).

	abstract = {In an era of changing financial landscapes, the position of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as possible national currencies is worth investigating. This study investigates Bitcoin's adherence to currency criteria and its consequences for GDP development in a certain country. The mining industry plays a significant role in the GDP of many countries. The extraction of raw materials such as metals, minerals, and fossil fuels is essential for producing a wide range of goods and services. This generates jobs and tax revenues and supports economic growth. Understanding these processes is critical, given the ongoing debate about Bitcoin's place in modern economies. This research looks into Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency and its possible influence on a certain country's GDP. The results show that Bitcoin fits the requirements for money, acting as a means of exchange and a store of value, with features including mobility, divisibility, commensurability, and fungibility. When examining its influence on GDP, empirical data indicate that, while currency appreciation may provide the illusion of stronger GDP growth when denominated in foreign currency, it damages growth domestically. According to a neural network study, Bitcoin's large impact on GDP renders it unsuitable for use as a national currency in the Czech Republic. Despite matching currency criteria, Bitcoin's adoption confronts problems such as volatility, a lack of central authority, and its worldwide nature, which limit its usefulness in promoting national economic growth. This analysis emphasizes country selection and length restrictions, finding that Bitcoin's existing position as an investment instrument restricts its viability as a national currency. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, one major drawback of blockchain investments is their substantial energy consumption, which has negative impacts on both the economy and the environment. The main cause of concern is the generation of atmospheric carbon emissions resulting from excessive energy usage. This research study aims to identify blockchain networks and systems that assert themselves as environmentally friendly and determine which of them produces the least amount of carbon emissions, such as Cardano, Tezos, and Bitgreen. This has been accomplished by following a comprehensive hybrid literature review. Our study has identified 23 blockchain networks that consume significantly less power and release fewer carbon dioxide emissions compared to the Bitcoin network. Some of these environmentally friendly networks include Algorand, Fantom, MobileCoin, and Electroneum. Additionally, we have found various projects and organizations that support greener blockchain initiatives, such as the Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism, Green Digital Finance Alliance, GreenTrust, and the Energy Web Foundation. While several projects in this area have been recognized and examined, comprehensive research and analysis are still needed to provide empirical evidence regarding the power consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of these claimed environmentally friendly blockchains. This is due to the relatively early stage of development in this field. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The rapid adoption and growing prominence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have sparked significant interest and debate among economists, policymakers, and financial analysts. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional financial systems often face challenges such as limited access to banking services, high transaction costs, and volatile currencies, Bitcoin presents both opportunities and risks. Understanding the interplay between Bitcoin and key monetary indicators such as monetary aggregates, exchange rates, and interest rates can provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in these economies. This study therefore seeks to investigate the nexus between monetary indicators and Bitcoin in selected Sub-Saharan African countries using a Panel ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) approach. The analysis focuses on understanding the dynamic relationship between key monetary variables, such as monetary aggregates, exchange rates, interest rates, and Bitcoin prices, from 2010 quarter three to 2022 quarter four. The findings reveal several significant relationships between monetary indicators and Bitcoin across the selected Sub-Saharan African countries. In the short run of the Panel Ardl monetary aggregates exhibit a positive relationship with Bitcoin prices, indicating that changes in the money supply may influence the demand for cryptocurrencies. Conversely, both exchange rates and interest rates show a negative relationship with Bitcoin prices in the short run, suggesting that currency depreciat ion and higher borrowing costs may reduce demand for Bitcoin. In the long run, the relationship between monetary aggregates and Bitcoin remains positive, emphasizing the potential influence of money supply on cryptocurrency markets over time. However, the significance of exchange rates diminishes, indicating a less pronounced impact in the longer term. Interestingly, interest rates continue to exhibit a significant negative relationship with Bitcoin prices in the long run, highlighting the persistent effect of borrowing costs on cryptocurrency demand. These results have important implications for policymakers, investors, and researchers interested in the intersection of monetary policy and cryptocurrency markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Policymakers may consider the impact of monetary policy decisions on cryptocurrency adoption and market dynamics, while investors can use these insights to inform their investment strategies. © 2024, ASERS Publishing House.

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies—i.e., digital or virtual currencies secured by cryptography based on blockchain technology, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum—have brought transformative changes to the global economic landscape. These innovative transaction methods have rapidly made their mark in the financial sector, reshaping the dynamics of the global economy. However, there remains a notable hesitation in its widespread acceptance and adoption, largely due to misconceptions and lack of proper guidance about its use. Such gaps in understanding create an opportunity to address these concerns. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study develops a parsimonious model to explain the awareness, acceptance, and adoption of cryptocurrency. The model was assessed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 332 participants aged 18 to 40 years. The findings suggest that cryptocurrency awareness plays a direct, positive, and significant role in shaping cryptocurrency adoption and that this positive relationship is mediated by factors that exemplify cryptocurrency acceptance, namely the ease of use and usefulness of cryptocurrency. The results also reveal that trust is a significant factor that strengthens these direct and mediating relationships. These insights emphasize the necessity of fostering an informed understanding of cryptocurrencies to accelerate their broader adoption in the financial ecosystem. By addressing the misconceptions and reinforcing factors like ease of use, usefulness, and trust, policymakers and financial institutions can better position themselves to integrate and promote cryptocurrency in mainstream financial systems. © 2024, The Author(s).},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a data set of 58 state-level marijuana decriminalisation and legalisation bills and referenda in the USA in 2010–2022. Findings: Decriminalisation is associated with a strong and consistent positive Bitcoin price response around the event, recreational legalisation induces a more ambiguous reaction and medical legalisation is found to have a negative albeit small impact on Bitcoin value. This suggests decriminalisation enhances shadow economy use value of Bitcoin, whereas recreational and medical legalisation are not consistently reducing illicit drug cryptomarket activity. The effects are robust to various estimation windows, in subsamples, and also when outliers, heavy tails, conditional heteroskedasticity and state size are accounted for. Originality/value: New to the literature, the choice of US marijuana bills, specifically as sample events, is based on both theoretical and empirical grounds. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: The global economy faced increased instability due to the simultaneous occurrence of two major events, the global pandemic in 2020 and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2022, which impacted the financial markets. Purpose: This paper aimed to evaluate the comovements between the USA (S&P 500), Germany (DAX 30), France (CAC40), Japan (Nikkei 225), Canada (TSX), Russia (MOEX) and Ukraine (PFTS) stock markets and the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litcoin (LTC) Dash (DASH/USD), Ripple (XRP) DigiByte (DGB) and Nem (XEM), from February 24, 2022, to April 12, 2023 Methods: The approach to our research question will involve using the causality econometric model, Granger SVAR (Vector Autoregressive). Results: The results showed that stock indices and digital currencies show sharp structural breaks, and not all markets influence cryptocurrencies. The MOEX stock market affects the price formation of BTC, ETH, DGB, XEM, and XRP, while the DAX 30 stock index impacts ETH, LTC, DASH, DGB, and XEM. The Ukraine market (PFTS) influences ETH, but the other stock markets do not influence any of the cryptocurrencies analysed. Conclusion: Investors, policymakers, and other participants operating in the digital currency markets can find valuable information in the study's conclusions when seeking to rebalance their portfolios. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

For this purpose, the sample included a range of economies with the highest number of Bitcoin usages or transactions, according to recent international rankings. With specific empirical means on panel data modelling, we attempted to show that economic growth, was influenced negatively by the cryptocurrency ‘Bitcoin’, and we concluded that this instrument leads to an increase in the inflation rate in a country according to the quantity theory of money and leads to a disorder in the monetary policy of a country. Our framework shows that the economic growth proxy was substantially influenced positively by economic indicators such as technology, investment and education but negatively by the high rate of participation, which caused an increase in unemployment. Our empirical results offer insights and insist on the importance of the intervention of the authorities to oversee and control the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin to avoid its negative effects and implement a strategy that overcomes these effects from a macroeconomic perspective.

	abstract = {In light of the increasing investor interest in cryptocurrencies (CR) as alternative financial assets in financial markets, we sought to examine the connection between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and cryptocurrencies. To do so, monthly data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (THT) from January 2021 to April 2023 were employed. We utilized quantile regression and Granger causality analysis to investigate the relationship between EPU and cryptocurrencies. The initial results of this study suggest that EPU has little effect on the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. To enhance the strength and validity of these findings, we performed separate evaluations tailored to the unique contexts of the United States and China. The results revealed that the effects of EPU were adverse and statistically insignificant for China, while the situation differed slightly for the United States. Given that the United States has the most developed economy, its policies have a significant influence globally. As a result, cryptocurrencies have the potential to serve as efficient hedging tools. Furthermore, we incorporated nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) analysis to assess the asymmetric impact of EPU on cryptocurrencies by adopting both short-term and long-term perspectives. The outcomes demonstrated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum can serve as hedging tools in the short-term, although this utility diminishes in the long-term. Conversely, Tether displayed a positive association with EPU in the long-term. The findings of this study hold significance for policy-makers, offering valuable insights related to structuring efficient policies. The recommendations include fostering a rational framework for active participation from various stakeholders, including investors, governmental bodies, central banks, stock exchanges, and financial institutions. This collaborative effort aims to mitigate irrational fluctuations and enhance the acceptability of cryptocurrencies. In essence, this research underscores the potential of cryptocurrencies as a secure hedge against short-term EPU. However, we caution against assuming that any single cryptocurrency can consistently serve as a dependable investment haven. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The relevance of the research is due to the rapid development of the digital economy and the emergence of innovative financial technology – cryptocurrency, which allows making international payments with minimal transaction fees, making investments, moving tangible and intangible assets. Assessment of cryptocurrency is the subject of this article. The purpose of the research is to develop the author's methodology for integral assessment of the quality of cryptocurrency and its testing. The leading research method of this problem is modeling, based on the analysis of Russian and foreign cryptocurrency assessment experience, the identification of value properties of different types of cryptocurrencies and their classification by the criterion of the manifestation areas, which allowed to develop an integral value-based methodology for assessing the quality of cryptocurrency and conduct an experimental calculation of the main types of cryptocurrencies using this methodology. The paper presents an integral value-based methodology for assessing the quality of cryptocurrencies. By means of a comparative approach, we carried out an analysis of methods for evaluating cryptocurrencies abroad. The article identifies four areas of value - value categories (functional, technological, economic, psychological), 18 value subcategories, 65 value criteria and 93 gradations of value of cryptocurrencies, and built an integrated model of value assessment of cryptocurrencies in the form of a four-level “value tree”. The gradation of value was carried out in the range from 1 to 10 units. The evaluation was carried out by expert method. The model is intended for use by operators of cryptocurrency exchanges, investors and crypto market specialists and is focused on the development of scientific and methodological support for the evaluation of cryptocurrencies. As a result of the research, an experimental calculation of the integral quality index of the 10 major cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization was carried out. It was concluded that the method of integral assessment of the quality of cryptocurrencies proposed by the author is correct for all types of cryptocurrencies, including national digital currencies. The only limitation is the completeness of information on the creation and functioning of the assessed cryptocurrency.The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper in short terms, i.e. 150–250 words. #CSOC1120. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Design/methodology/approach: We used an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for panel data and performed robustness checks by utilizing a random effect model (REM) and generalized method of moments (GMM). There are 25 most adopted cryptocurrency’s countries and the data spans from 22 March 2021 to 6 May 2022. Findings: This research discovered four findings: (1) the index of COVID-19 vaccine confidence (VCI) recovers the economic and Bitcoin has become more attractive, causing investors to shift their investment from Dogecoin to Bitcoin. However, the VCI was revealed to be insignificant to Ripple; (2) during uncertain times, Bitcoin could perform as a diversifier, while Ripple could behave as a diversifier, safe haven or hedge. Meanwhile, the movement of Dogecoin prices tended to be influenced by public figures’ actions; (3) public opinion on Twitter and government policy changes regarding COVID-19 and economy had a crucial role in investment decision making; and (4) the COVID-19 variants revealed insignificant results to payment-based system cryptocurrency returns. Originality/value: This study contributed to verifying the vaccine confidence index effect on payment-based system cryptocurrency returns. Also, we further investigated the uncertainty indicators impacting on cryptocurrency returns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we utilized the COVID-19 variants as a cryptocurrency returns’ new determinant. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation of the world economy has updated the issues of using digital technologies in the system of cross-border payments. The key moment was the introduction of virtual currencies into monetary systems and payment turnover. The circulation of cryptocurrencies along with fiat money in the global economy has created paradoxical situations that require research both scientific, theoretical and applied context. The subject of the study is the payment functionality of digital currencies. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibility of using cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for cross-border payments within the existing traditional financial system, both in the general context and with the application of sanctions restrictions that hamper international settlements in traditional methods. In the process of research, content analysis, retrospective analysis, methods of logical and comparative analysis were used. This study is one of the first to explore the possibility of using bitcoin in cross-border payments under sanctions restrictions. It is shown that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is the most important characteristic that limits their use as payment instruments, but this risk can be neutralized by using cryptocurrency as a transit instrument, as a temporary intermediary in the exchange of fiat currencies. The conclusion is made about the possibility of using cryptocurrencies as a transit instrument in the implementation of exports and imports settlements in toxic currencies of unfriendly countries, and to use the Central Bank Digital Currencies in cross-border settlements within the framework of integration and non-integration interstate associations with the participation of Russia. © Krylova L.V., 2024.},

Unfortunately, in emerging African countries, few studies conducted on volatility spillovers failed to adequately establish the significance and pattern of volatility spillover effects between returns on Bitcoin, stock markets and exchange rates. Hence, the need for this study using the diagonal-BEKK approach. While Botswana had an inverse pattern of spillovers, Tunisia had a positive pattern. Bitcoin and stock prices both had volatility spillover effects between each other in South Africa. South Africa and Namibia were the only countries with significant volatility spillovers between stock prices and exchange rates. In countries like Kenya that had significant cross-volatility from the stock market to the exchange rate, news about the stock market stimulated reactions from investors that impacted volatility within the market. This volatility creates a multiplier effect on other economic circles of influence, depending on whether reactions are favourable to the market or unfavourable. When volatility in the Kenyan stock market rises, exchange rates in the next period experience less volatility, against the common theory that investors’ actions that cause volatility in the stock market cause withdrawal of investments. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology, initially developed for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has expanded its reach into various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and real estate. The technology's transparency, and security have led many to view it as self-auditing. On the other hand, as blockchain integrates into traditional business models, the necessity for formal auditing processes akin to those in the nonblockchain corporate (business) world becomes evident and highly important. The present research explores the hesitancy among audit firms (statutory auditors) to engage in blockchain auditing, delving into the technological, regulatory, and inherent risks that make blockchain a challenging terrain for auditors and their work. The present research outlines the evolution of the blockchain environment, detailing its historical progression and diverse platforms. This finding underscores the crucial role of auditing in ensuring transparency, trust, and corporate (business) sustainability. The challenges faced by audit firms in the blockchain space, including technical complexities, regulatory ambiguities, and inherent risks such as cryptocurrency market volatility/risk, are extensively discussed. Practical case studies such as those of DAO attack, QuadrigaCX's missing funds, and the scrutiny of Bitfinex and Tether illustrate the consequences of inadequate auditing in blockchain platforms. Potential solutions for these challenges have been put forth, with an emphasis on the following: collaborative learning and training, advocacy for regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and the development of auditing standards specific to blockchain. The study culminates by emphasising the consequences of audit firms' ongoing reluctance towards blockchain technology and the advantages that can be gained by surmounting these obstacles. The aforementioned discovery implies that a mutually beneficial association between auditors and the blockchain industry may usher in an unprecedented epoch characterised by enhanced market economy transparency, confidence, and ingenuity. A comparison of conventional and blockchain auditing methods is presented in the appendices, with an emphasis on the distinctions between the two approaches. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

	abstract = {In South Korea, the polarization of wealth is very serious, and its pace is faster than in other countries. Recently, investments in instruments such as stocks, bitcoins and in real estate are seen as decisive factors that intensify the polarization of wealth in South Korea. The motivation for this study is to analyze effects of investment on polarization of wealth. We carried out a study focused on the impact of investments on the polarization of wealth. In this study, we analyzed the effect of investment on the polarization of wealth. We studied the effect of real estate, stocks, and bitcoin on the polarization of wealth. We conducted multiple regression analysis on the income quintile share ratio, real estate, stocks, and bitcoins and then carry out multiple regression analysis with interest rates, household debt, incomes, and price indices. In order to analyze the investment impact on the polarization of wealth, the public data (2015–2020) from the government and institutions were utilized. Results showed that real estate, stocks, and bitcoins set as investment instruments in this study did not have a significant impact on the polarization of wealth. It is because the popularity of investments in real estates, stocks, and bitcoins in South Korea began in earnest from 2020, and has actually accelerated the polarization of wealth. This study has the theoretical contribution because the impact of investments on the polarization of wealth is analyzed, and policies for economic stability are discussed and presented. In addition, a new academic contribution of this study is to analyze the investment and polarization of wealth at the same time. © 2024 The Author},

	abstract = {Blockchain Technology has garnered significant attention due to its immense potential to transform the way transactions are conducted and information is managed. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that is spread across a network of computers, ensuring the secure, transparent, and unchangeable recording of transactions. However, the energy consumption of certain blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, and others has generated apprehensions regarding the sustainability of this technology. Bitcoin alone consumes approximately 100 terawatt-hours annually, contributing significantly to global carbon emissions. The substantial energy requirements not only contribute to carbon emissions but also pose a risk to the long-term viability of the blockchain industry. This study reviews articles from eight reputable databases between 2017 to August 2023, employing the systematic review and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses approach for screening. Therefore, explore the applications of sustainable blockchain networks aimed at reducing environmental impact while ensuring efficiency and security. This survey also assesses the challenges and limitations posed by diverse blockchain applications regarding sustainability and provides valuable foresight into potential future advancements. Through this survey, the aim is to track and verify sustainable practices, facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and promoting environmental stewardship, with a specific focus on highlighting the potential of sustainable blockchain networks in enabling secure and transparent tracking of these practices. Finally, the paper sheds light on pertinent research challenges and provides a roadmap of future directions, stimulating further research in this promising field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {On September 7th, 2021, El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, opening up its rapidly developing coast to a new form of crypto tourism and investment. Given the potential access it provides to those outside the traditional banking system, Bitcoin proponents – most notably Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele – have touted the ability of Bitcoin to promote “economic freedom,” poverty alleviation, and development in the country. In the rural coastal community of El Zonte, Bitcoin has been pioneered as a tool for everyday transactions and social programs targeting the town's majority poor population. As Bitcoin enthusiasts have flocked to El Zonte, inspired by the imaginary of a Bitcoin-friendly paradise, these mostly White crypto tourists from the Global North have bought up land, patronized exclusive hotels and resorts, and rebranded the town as “Bitcoin Beach.” Drawing on the case study of El Zonte, this article unpacks the material implications and contradictions of Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. I argue that while Bitcoin has created some opportunities for small-scale aid and the business sector, these benefits are limited and largely undermined by the uneven and neocolonial impacts of crypto on local people, land and resources, and power. Situating the findings from El Zonte within a broader discursive and political analysis of Bitcoin legalization in El Salvador, the paper warns of the ways in which crypto facilitates novel forms of territorial, resource, and political control, while reproducing many of the uneven dynamics of neoliberal economic development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Daily data are from January 11, 2016 to February 12, 2024, and the methods employed include quantile-on-quantile return connectedness (QQC), cross-quantilogram (CQ), and Granger causality in quantiles (GC), which allow us to make inferences about the safe-haven ability of green bonds. The QQC results establish that the connectedness at directly related quantiles is more pronounced than those of inversely related quantiles for all cases. The degree of return connectedness is highest with conventional bonds, followed by gold and stocks. Green bonds act as the net transmitter of spillover shocks to Bitcoin and gold markets, whereas it serves as the receiver of shocks from the remaining markets. The CQ results indicate that positive returns in green bonds significantly follow negative returns in conventional bonds 5 days later, suggesting that green bonds have a one-week lagged safe-haven ability. The GC from green bonds is bidirectional and mostly intensified in extreme quantiles with oil, cryptocurrencies, and conventional stocks, but unidirectional and visible with Islamic stocks during market downturns. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The method is to compare the agents’ and bank's Cobb Douglas utilities over two periods. The conclusions are that the bank prefers to print fiat money to a certain extent. Fiat money printing benefits the borrower/buyer which prefers inflation, benefits the bank if not excessive, and hurts the seller and nontraders. The seller and nontraders prefer a hard money economy or a fiat economy where the bank withdraws money to ensure deflation. More nontraders decrease inflation since the bank's money printing gets spread across more agents.

	abstract = {This article aims to analyse the hedging, diversifier and safe-haven properties of Bitcoin for the US Dollar Index (USDI). We explore the long-term relationship between USDI and Bitcoin by estimating a Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) model with two regimes. Thus, the data used cover the period from 18 January 2010 to 30 June 2017 for both USDI and Bitcoin. The empirical findings based on the analysis of the MS-AR model report that investing in Bitcoin involves more benefits than USDI even if the economy is in a recession. However, by examining Bitcoin and USDI volatility, the research findings underline positive dependency between the two. Such results denote that Bitcoin does not act as a hedge, and not even as a safe haven, against USDI. We found that Bitcoin is merely a diversifier for USDI. Accordingly, the outcomes will help investors and portfolio risk managers to make more up-to-date investment analyses and decisions. © 2020 IMI.},

Accordingly, this study investigates the influence of Bitcoin's energy consumption (BEC), as a representative of the cryptocurrency market, on the regional green economy indices of the United States, Europe, and Asia. Utilizing both unfiltered and filtered data, we conduct empirical analyses from both static and dynamic perspectives to account for the causal relationships that emerged during critical market developments, employing novel algorithms including forward recursive, rolling windows, and recursive rolling. The results reveal that energy-related developments play a dominant role in shaping the causal link between BEC and the green economy performance. More specifically, events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and China's ban on cryptocurrency mining appear to significantly drive casual effects. After filtering out the impacts of global equity markets and information technology developments, we observe even more pronounced impacts on these causal relationships. Our findings highlight the need for coordinated global actions to address the energy consumption of the cryptocurrency market, facilitating the transition to global sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The swift evolution of information technology in the last two decades has heralded the era of Society 5.0, wherein cryptocurrencies have emerged as forefront innovations. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as digital assets and payment mechanisms, champion decentralized finance and worldwide connectivity via blockchain technology. The burgeoning interest in cryptocurrencies within Indonesia, underscored by Bappebti's data revealing a positive trajectory with over 17.91 million crypto investors by September 2023, underscores the imperative for innovative applications of Bitcoin in digital payments. This necessity gave rise to BITPAYS, an application devised to bolster the digital economy's growth within the Society 5.0 paradigm. Designed for ease of use, BITPAYS simplifies employing Bitcoin in everyday transactions. With the soaring popularity of cryptocurrencies, BITPAYS aspires to fulfill the demand for pioneering payment solutions. Observing the successful incorporation of cryptocurrencies as payment methods in the United States and Russia, Indonesia stands to draw inspiration, contingent upon the establishment of conducive regulatory frameworks. This research delves into leveraging Bitcoin as a digital payment instrument to foster the digital economy's expansion in the Society 5.0 era. It further explores BITPAYS' application implementation to streamline daily Bitcoin transaction activities. This study aims to underscore Bitcoin's role as a digital payment medium and elucidate BITPAYS application operations. Employing a descriptive analytical methodology and the ADDIE model for BITPAYS application development, this investigation seeks to offer comprehensive insights into cryptocurrency utilization as a digital payment alternative in Indonesia. BITPAYS is anticipated to significantly enhance cryptocurrency investment value and simplify everyday transactions, thereby elevating public consciousness of Bitcoin's utility and advantages as a payment method. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Technical development has brought about many positives in the commercial field. Still, it has not been without negatives resulting from the misuse of modern technologies in commercial transactions illegally, perhaps the most prominent of which is the commission of currency smuggling and money laundering operations through electronic means, which have become one of the major challenges facing countries today. By exploiting modern electronic payment methods, and using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is used to hide the identity of financial assets and make them easily transferable around the world. These currencies provide high confidentiality, making them attractive to criminals. In addition to the use of money transfer platforms, applications such as “Zelle” and “Venmo” are used to transfer illicit funds and hide them across multiple accounts, complicating investigators’ efforts to track the funds. E-commerce platforms are used to conduct quick transactions and hide illicit funds in minutes or even seconds. In addition, some exploit the foreign currency sales window and electronic payment cards to achieve their goals in this area.Since currency smuggling and money laundering have become a major threat to the national economy, they lead to: Decline in purchasing power: Currency smuggling leads to a decrease in the value of the national currency, which causes a decline in the purchasing power of citizens, Increase in poverty and crime: Decline in purchasing power leads to an increase in the poverty rate, which contributes to the spread of crimes such as theft and bribery, in addition to economic losses, as currency smuggling deprives the state of due taxes, which leads to large losses in the state budget, in addition to the occurrence of waves of inflation, as currency smuggling leads to an increase in the prices of goods and services, which increases inflation rates. Therefore, it was necessary for the legislator to develop advanced and flexible legislation aimed at confronting the misuse of means of technological development in currency smuggling and money laundering. It became necessary for the active banking authorities, headed by the central banks, to monitor, follow up and diagnose the new means invented by currency smugglers and money launderers in order to develop instructions and regulations that would limit these suspicious operations and protect the national economy. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

In doing so, we apply a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Auto-Regression (TVP-VAR) model, a dynamic connectedness approach and network analysis. The empirical results indicate that cryptocurrency returns and monetary policy spillovers were particularly large when shadow policy rates became negative, moderated during the Fed's ‘tapering process’, and sharpened again more recently as cryptocurrency buoyancy returned. Gross directional spillovers suggest that shadow policy rates have more ‘to give than to receive’, while those from and to cryptocurrency returns are naturally volatile. There is also strong interconnectedness between monetary policy in either the US or the Eurozone and the UK, and between Bitcoin and Litecoin. However, the spillovers across monetary policy and cryptocurrencies tend to be muted. Finally, spillovers were only slightly larger during the Fed's ‘unconventional’ policy compared to the ‘standard’ era, but their composition qualitatively changed over time. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Bitcoin’s (BT) energy demand due to the proof of work mining algorithm and transaction methods has been criticized in recent literature because of BT’s global energy consumption (EC) being equal to or even greater than that of some industrialized economies. This study explores the contagion and causality dynamics under nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity with Markovian-type regime switches among BT price volatility, EC from BT, and its effects on the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with a daily sample of January 2, 2012–December 24, 2023. In the empirical methodology, following the preliminary tests that indicated nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity, this study employed novel Markov-switching-based nonlinear volatility copula and causality models to capture the marginal distributions of BT, its EC and CO2 emissions, and their joint distributions for contagion and tail dependence and determine nonlinear and asymmetric causality relations in distinct regimes of high and low volatility governed by Markov chains. The empirical results indicate significant and positive copula parameters with high magnitudes demonstrating asymmetric contagion and tail dependence occurring at the extreme levels of BT price volatility in the upper and lower tails during both regimes. Novel Markov-switching-based copula causality tests designated unidirectional causality from BT to CO2, as well as from BT’sECtoCO2 emissions during each regime coupled with existent bidirectional causality confirming cyclical feedback effects between BT prices and its EC in both regimes. For robustness and comparison, single-regime copula models were employed, and their findings confirmed the results concerning significant and positive tail dependence and contagion. However, the single-regime approach led to a set of inconsistencies in causality results owing to omitting nonlinearity while capturing heteroskedasticity and confirming the nonrejection of causality between BT, EC, and CO2 emissions. Important policy recommendations include green alternatives to cryptocurrency-mining algorithms. © 2024 Melike E. Bildirici and Özgür Ömer Ersin.},

We attribute this discrepancy to BTC's relative energy inefficiency, which contrasts with ETH's commitment to transitioning to a more energy-efficient mining protocol over our sample period. Additionally, we show that the effect of electricity consumption on cryptocurrencies is mitigated by media coverage and policy uncertainty regarding the state of the economy, environment, and cryptocurrency markets.

	abstract = {One of the main current focuses of global economies and decision-makers is the efficiency of energy utilization in cryptocurrency mining and trading, along with the reduction of associated carbon emissions. Understanding the pattern of Bitcoin's energy consumption and its bubble frequency can greatly enhance policy analysis and decision-making for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction. This research aims to assess the validity of the random walk hypothesis for Bitcoin's electricity consumption and carbon footprint. We employed both traditional methods (ADF and KPSS) and recently proposed unit root techniques that account for structural breaks and non-linearity in the data series. Our analysis covers daily data from July 2010 to December 2021. The empirical results revealed that traditional unit root techniques did not confirm the stationarity of both bitcoin's electricity consumption and carbon footprint. However, novel structural break (SB) and linearity tests conducted enabled us to discover five SB episodes between 2012 and 2020 and non-linearity of the variables, which informed our application of the newly developed non-linear unit root tests with structural breaks. With the new methods, the results indicated stationarity after accommodating the SB and non-linearity. Furthermore, based on Phillips and Shi (2019)'s test, we identified certain bubble episodes in the bitcoin energy and carbon variables between 2013 and 2021. The major drivers of the bubbles in bitcoin energy consumption and carbon footprint are variables relating to the bitcoin and financial markets activities and risks, including the global economic and political risks. The study's conclusion based on the above findings informs several policy implications drawn for energy and environmental management including the encouragement of green investments in cryptocurrency mining and trading. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Cryptocurrency signifies a fundamental change in the understanding of currency and financial transactions. The fundamental tenets of decentralisation, cryptographic security, and limited supply seek to revolutionise the conventional financial environment, providing fresh opportunities for financial inclusion, transparency, and innovation. Nevertheless, the path of cryptocurrencies is being influenced by ongoing challenges, such as regulatory uncertainties and market volatility, as they progressively establish themselves as a vital component of the global economy. It can be deduced that Dogecoin lacks the ability to supplant Bitcoin. Ethereum and Bitcoin exhibit a notably higher level of security compared to Dogecoin and Bit connect. That is the rationale behind their ability to withstand the decline in 2018 and also endure the current decrease in price. The depreciation of dogecoin is inevitable. Dogecoin is a valid and authentic form of digital currency. Nonetheless, the cultural structure of dogecoin ultimately undermines its own triumph. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the advent of Bitcoin, a cryptographically-enabled peer-to-peer digital payment system, blockchain together with a whole package of distributed ledger technologies, which serve as the underlying foundation of all the crypto-currencies, have been gaining attention from both academia and industry in the last fifteen years. The recent years have witnessed tremendous momentum in the development of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, largely due to the impressive rise in the market capital of these digital tokens. More and more industries, from banking and insurance, to supply chain and e-commerce, are quickly realizing the great potential in blockchain technology in efficiency boost, process automation and secure data sharing across otherwise isolated data silos. Furthermore, as the recognition of the data value began to sink in, data assets has become an essential part of the development of enterprises and countries. Blockchain technology is regarded as the foundation of digital economy and provides an effective approach for data ownership, pricing and transactions, which are the core issues of data asset management. However, the potential implications of Blockchain technologies go far beyond their application as the technological backbone for cryptocurrencies. Web3.0, using blockchain as underlying technology, allow for various novel application scenarios, which are built upon distributed consensus and thus are hard to block or censor while providing public verifiability of peer-to-peer transactions without a trusted central party. Web3.0 are expected to become the main front for a plethora of highly expressive applications. To more thoroughly explore the potential of blockchain and web3.0 and promote their progress, SDBD'24 will provide a forum for the most recent blockchain and web3.0 research, innovations, and applications, bridging the gap between theory and practice in the design.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {New forms of money invite informed speculation regarding future possibilities. In this extended commentary, we explore five issue-areas that the growth of cryptocurrency and, more particularly, stablecoin have evoked. This new form of digital money has the potential to change the form and functioning of payments technologies and thus alter not just how something is paid for but what can be paid for. Moreover, as the now shelved plans for Facebook/Meta's Libra/Diem indicate, there is scope for a major corporation or coalition of corporations to issue their own stablecoin and this greatly increases the likelihood of a 'systemic' stablecoin. This, in turn, could change where power resides and who exercises it in banking, finance and society. Concern with power leads to issues regarding the nature of change and thus to concern with possible financial, economic and social disruptions ranging across the nature of trust, bank business models, the effectiveness of central bank policy and security of payments systems. Given these issues, cryptocurrency and stablecoin have become a growing concern for regulators and this concern extends to the case for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). Finally, a new form of money invites discussion of its implications for the nature of money and this leads to matters of philosophical or social theory interest. &copy; 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Through cooperation, robot swarms can perform tasks or solve problems that a single robot from the swarm could not perform/solve by itself. However, it has been shown that a single Byzantine robot (such as a malfunctioning or malicious robot) can disrupt the coordination strategy of the entire swarm. Therefore, a versatile swarm robotics framework that addresses security issues in inter-robot communication and coordination is urgently needed. Here, we show that security issues can be addressed by setting up a token economy between the robots. To create and maintain the token economy, we used blockchain technology, originally developed for the digital currency Bitcoin. The robots were given crypto tokens that allowed them to participate in the swarm’s security-critical activities. The token economy was regulated via a smart contract that decided how to distribute crypto tokens among the robots depending on their contributions. We designed the smart contract so that Byzantine robots soon ran out of crypto tokens and could therefore no longer influence the rest of the swarm. In experiments with up to 24 physical robots, we demonstrated that our smart contract approach worked: The robots could maintain blockchain networks, and a blockchain-based token economy could be used to neutralize the destructive actions of Byzantine robots in a collective-sensing scenario. In experiments with more than 100 simulated robots, we studied the scalability and long-term behavior of our approach. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility and viability of blockchain-based swarm robotics. Copyright © 2023 T Authors, some rights reserved.},

Blockchain technology permits you to distribute, encrypt, and secure the records of digital transactions. In addition, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are encompassed in it. Even though the construction industry has traditionally been a late user of innovative technology compared to other sectors of the economy, it faces various hurdles in terms of trust, accessibility, information sharing, and process automation. As a result, stakeholders, clients, subcontractors, contractors, and suppliers have been unable to work together effectively. Even if building information modeling is employed, which envisions a centralized building, the primary benefit of blockchain is the secure storage of sensitive sensor data. © 2023, Kare Publishing.

	abstract = {The rise of cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin, has opened up a lot of doors in the world of Financial Technology (FinTech) by attracting investors, media, and financial industry regulators. Bitcoin operates on blockchain technology, and its value is not a determinant of the value of a tangible asset, an organisation, or a country’s economy. Instead, it relies on an encryption technique that allows tracking of all transactions. Globally, over $2 trillion has been generated through cryptocurrency trading. Due to these financial prospects, the youths in Nigeria have cashed in on this virtual currency to create employment and wealth. This research investigates the adoption and sustainability of bitcoin and blockchain in Nigeria. A survey method with a non-probability purposive sampling technique and a homogeneous approach was employed to collect 320 responses via an online survey. Descriptive and correlational analysis in IBM SPSS version 25 was used to analyse the collected data. According to the findings, bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, with 97.5% acceptance, and is expected to be the leading virtual currency in the next five years. The research findings will help researchers and authorities comprehend the need for cryptocurrency adoption, leading to its sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.},

In the new global economy, rapid time to market has become a central issue: developers fail to scrutinize their blockchain designs prior to deployment and customers undergo negative experiences that hurt the widespread adoption of the blockchain technology. Previous published studies aimed for effective blockchain simulators. However, existing solutions exhibit several drawbacks: they rely on guesswork, conceal low-level implementation details, lack expected realistic outcomes and automated testing, as well as lag in smart contract vulnerability analysis. In this paper, we introduce highsimb: the first concrete blockchain high simulation platform for Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric that supports smart contract vulnerability detection. Unlike a testnet, the blockchain tester can customize any low-level detail to achieve realistic expected results under automated testing. Theoretical analysis demonstrates our concrete simulator is highly observable, supports realistic feedback, is scalable, detects smart contract vulnerabilities, has strong white-box testing capabilities and automates experiments. Our framework complements existing blockchain simulators and introduces a novel development paradigm for blockchain testing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The cryptocurrency is a social, cultural, and technological advancement that goes far beyond financial innovation. Cryptocurrencies have the ability to significantly boost the economy due to their openness. Digital assets governed by cryptographic methods are called cryptocurrencies. Different cryptocurrency subtypes exist. The most well-known cryptocurrency is arguably Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin has developed into a legitimate investment option and is on its way to having a significant impact on the globe. With an increase of almost 87% in 2019, Bitcoin's had been doing pretty well till mid February 2020.This cryptocurrency fell by over 15% at the month's end. This crisis occurred as world stocks collapsed as a result of COVID-19. But the use of cryptocurrencies globally surged by 880% in 2021, according to the Global Crypto Adoption Index provided by Chainalysis. With an index score of 0.37, India came in second place after Vietnam. In just one year, the Indian cryptocurrency market grew by 641%. The international cryptocurrency market is very promising and is growing swiftly. It seems like it could be a market for India as well. It is hard to forecast what will happen to the bitcoin or cryptocurrency market in 2023 and beyond. But by keeping a watch on a few significant crypto patterns, we'll be able to make wiser investing decisions as the market matures. The future of cryptocurrency appears bright, and India is poised to take over the global market. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The study aimed to determine the positional content of the use of high technology in the system of solidarity of community members in the implementation of business processes to ensure efficiency in the socio-environmental and economic development triad. The general research methodology was based on a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of introducing high technology into the solidarity economy according to the following predictors: digitalization, informatization, and professionalization levels. Blockchain technology (N = 3,073 projects) was selected as an example of high technology, which is used to stimulate the decentralization of the economy and strengthen social influence in the solidarity economy. The use of complex research methods to achieve this goal - situational analysis, systems analysis, reproductive analysis, and structural-functional analysis - was proposed as the generalizing evaluation block. The research results confirmed the main hypothesis: the higher the level of socioeconomic development of the solidarity economy model in terms of digitalization (r=0.866), informatization (r = 0.754), and professionalization (r = 0.564), the more efficient socially-oriented business models that involve high technologies are in a particular territory. The study also shows that the blockchain can provide additional (65% of projects) and transformational solutions (25% of projects) for alternative energy projects. © 2022 Economic Affairs (New Delhi).

	abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis and global economic recession have shrunk the world's energy use, collapsed stock markets and crashed energy prices. Green economy projects are hence losing their focus and competitiveness, endangering the achievement of sustainable development goals and neutrality targets. The study aims to examine the dynamic linkages between the green economy, sustainability, Bitcoin, oil prices and stock markets. We do this by utilizing the daily data from August 2016 to August 2021 for the case of the United States. The recently developed quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) and quantile Granger causality methods are employed for empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that a green economy or green financing from institutions is very sensitive to economic shocks, oil price changes and overall sustainability changes. Similarly, empirical results further reveal that there is a negative association between sustainability with oil prices and sustainability with stock markets; that oil prices and stock markets are also sensitive to sustainability-related shifts. Our study advises investors who want to support sustainable development to include green assets in their portfolios, such as green bonds, which are a good substitute for clean energy or renewable energy stocks. This study reports some fruitful implications apropos of sustainable development goals and a green economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In the long run, except for Tether, all other cryptocurrencies are negatively affected by EPU, challenging the safe hedge properties of cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance coin and Ripple display positive relations with growing EPU in short run, reflecting their safe haven attributes over a shorter horizon. Additionally, these cryptocurrencies exhibit asymmetries in the short run. Further, we analyse the effect of US, Chinese and Indian EPU on bitcoin returns to understand the effect of EPU shocks of advanced and emerging economies. US EPU has long-run negative effects on bitcoin market, whereas Indian and Chinese EPU have no significant impact in long term. Moreover, our analysis also establishes the detrimental impact of the Indian government's crypto tax policy on bitcoin.

	abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the digital economy, digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have become increasingly popular among the public. Tracking and regulating digital currency transactions have become a challenging technology for the healthy development of the digital economy. That is because blockchain and peer-to-peer networks are the underlying technologies of digital currencies. Blockchain transaction has some new features, such as stronger anonymity and distributed storage. Therefore, it is difficult for the regulatory system to track the transaction relationships among users. Recent studies have shown that the accuracy, time, and space costs of transaction tracking, as well as the trade-offs between them, still need to be improved. In this article, we propose a new blockchain transaction tracking model called BT2(Bitcoin Transaction Tracking Model). BT2 first combines an improved sampling aggregation algorithm with a graph neural network. And then, it exploits an inductive aggregation method to effectively generate rich node embeddings for a small number of unobserved nodes. Next, the node embedding vectors are used to generate edge information among nodes through message-passing functions. Finally, we can use the edge information to obtain the relations among Bitcoin accounts. This paper evaluates the model on the real-world dataset and explores the impact of various parameters, such as network depth and iteration time, etc. From the experimental results, the model's average AUC (area under the ROC curve) can reach up to 0.93, and the average accuracy is 86%. The numerical results indicate that the performance of BT2 is better than the state of art methods.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Findings: The asymmetric effects of inflation, the size of Bitcoin economy, reveal a positive impact on the PB in the short and long run. In the short run, Bitcoin price shows negative statistically significant sensitivity to positive (negative) changes in DJIA (VIX) index. In addition, Google Trends have an impact on Bitcoin prices indicating that the Bitcoin market is also driven by investors' sentiments. In the long run, negative policy uncertainty shocks increase the PB while in the short run, negative shocks decrease it.

	abstract = {Bubbles in asset prices have attracted the attention of economists for centuries. Extreme increases in asset prices, followed by their sudden decline, create a turbulent effect on the economy and even invite crises in time. For this reason, some measurement techniques have been employed to investigate the price bubbles that may occur. This study explores the possible speculative price bubbles of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin cryptocurrencies, compares them with the pre-and post- COVID-19 period, and examines asymmetric causality relationships between variables. Therefore, we analyzed the price bubbles of these cryptocurrencies using the closing price for daily data between 16.01.2018 and 31.12.2021 by the Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) and the Hatemi-J (2012) asymmetric causality test. In this context, 1446 observations, 723 of which were before COVID-19 and 723 after COVID-19, were employed in the study. Looking at the SADF analysis results, we detected 103 price bubbles before COVID-19 for the three cryptocurrencies, while we determined 599 price bubbles after COVID-19. The common finding in the asymmetric causality test results is that there is a causality relationship between the negative shocks faced by one cryptocurrency and the positive shocks faced by the other cryptocurrencies. © This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to analyse COVID-19 indices and blockchain features on Bitcoin and Ethereum returns, respectively. The authors focus on the most used and owned cryptocurrencies that cover Europe, the US and Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach: An autoregressive distributed lag panel (pooled mean group and mean group) is utilized, and a robustness check is incorporated by using a Random Effect Model and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Findings: Four new findings were discovered, including (1) the vaccine confidence index (VCI) pushes economic recovery and increased demand for the Bitcoin market, but the opposite result was interestingly observed from Ethereum; (2) the blockchain features were revealed to be essential to Bitcoin, while they were irrelevant to Ethereum for short-run country-specific results; (3) the hash rate and network difficulty moved inversely during the pandemic; and (4) the government played a significant role in taking action during uncertain times and regarding cryptocurrency policies. Research limitations/implications: VCI is constructed by the most used vaccine type in our sample countries (i.e. Pfizer), as the data for a specific classification by each type is still unavailable. Practical implications: Providing an evenly distributed vaccination program primary vaccination series against COVID-19 to the citizens is an essential duty of the government. Bitcoin policymakers and investors should watch the COVID-19 vaccine distributions closely as it will affect its return. Ethereum is emphasized to keep developing its smart contract which appeared to outplay other blockchain features. Cryptocurrency investors should be wise in their investment decisions by analysing the news thoroughly. Social implications: This research emphasizes that the success in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination requires citizens' willingness to participate and their trust in the vaccine's efficacy. Such self-awareness and self-discipline in society can ultimately empower individuals and stabilise the economy. Nevertheless, the implementation of health protocols is still highly required to prevent the spread of new variants of COVID-19. Originality/value: This is the first study that attempts to construct a VCI which denotes the confidence derived from the administration of full-dose COVID-19 vaccines (an initial vaccine and a second vaccine). The authors further find the impact on cryptocurrency returns. Next, blockchain size is utilized as a new determinant of cryptocurrencies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The existing studies rarely reveal the reasons for the digital currency price fluctuation from the perspective of internal interaction and contagion. Therefore, to fill this research gap, this paper comprehensively adopts the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC-) GARCH model and wavelet coherence analysis (WTC) to reveal the internal correlation and formation reasons of digital currency price fluctuations. Our research has the following findings: (1) the price fluctuations of digital currency are highly related. Through the observation of the dynamic conditional correlation coefficient graph, it is found that the price fluctuations have a strong time-varying trend, manifested as a ‘contagious’ characteristic. (2) During the outbreak of COVID-19, most digital currencies have shown positive resonance in the short, medium, and long term, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the correlation and contagion of digital currency price fluctuations. (3) In the short term, Bitcoin is the main ‘contagious source’ of digital currency price fluctuation. But in the medium and long term, Ethereum and Ripple, which are closely related to the real economy, have a greater impact and become the new ‘contagious source’. Generally speaking, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are the internal causes of instability in the digital currency market. Finally, based on the empirical conclusion, this paper proposes that the digital currency portfolio should be optimized to meet the investment demand; strengthen digital currency regulatory cooperation, and improve regulatory efficiency. Let the digital currency return to the ‘currency’ attribute and serve the real economy. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cryptocurrency investment and trading are rapidly growing activities due to the development of applications and platforms that offer fast, continuous, and easy entry into the cryptocurrency world. To understand decision making in cryptocurrency holders, we assessed temporal discounting, that is, whether Bitcoin holders disregard rewards if they are distant in time and overvalue rewards if they are more immediate. Further, we compared performance between short-term investors (i.e., day-traders) vs. long-term investors. Methods: Using an online survey, we invited 144 Bitcoin holders to answer temporal discounting questionnaires dealing with money (“Which do you prefer, that you get right now 20 USD in cash or 100 USD in a month?”) and Bitcoin (“Which do you prefer, that you get right now 0.1 or 1 Bitcoin in a month?”). Results: Analysis demonstrated no significant differences between temporal discounting for money and Bitcoin. However, and critically, higher temporal discounting for both money and Bitcoin was observed in short-term investors compared with long-term investors. In a similar vein, significant positive correlations were observed between day trading and temporal discounting for both money and Bitcoin. Discussion: These findings demonstrate how Bitcoin holders with short-term time horizons tend to prioritize immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards. Future research can assess the neural basis of temporal discounting for cryptocurrencies. Copyright © 2023 El Haj and Moustafa.},

	abstract = {Unaccounted wealth (UW) is a large unsolved problem in India. The demonetisation exercise in November 2016 was an attempt to address it. As regulatory measures are taken to tackle UW, criminals identify newer ways to avoid detection, e.g., cryptocurrency usage for illicit activities, as it bypasses formal banking channels. This article examines evidence of change in cryptocurrency usage in the context of demonetisation. This is done by examining four datasets viz. keyword search for bitcoin (BTC), volume of BTC traded in India, price variation between USD/BTC/INR and BTC blockchain transaction dataset. The data indicates heightened awareness of cryptocurrency, increase in volume traded and increase in price spread between BTC/USD/INR, though unable to discern deviation in blockchain dataset due to India led transactions. Increasing BTC usage, given inability to regulate these transactions, supports move by Government of India to ban its usage till the technology and its implications are understood better.

	abstract = {The article describes some features of the media terminologization in the 21st century. The material for the study was about 1000 new terminological units found in the media sources, the fi rst written recording of which dates back to 2000–2020. The analysis of of new terminological vocabulary in the media of the 21st century showed that the process of terminologization of Russian speech is accompanied by the process of “false” terminologization of modern media, which arises as a result of the wide-spread phenomenon of the “terminological noise”. Terminological noise is defi ned as the background, stylistic fi lling of the media space with special lexis without its further adoption by common language, which consists of at least two trends: (1) using false terminological vocabulary in text and (2) sporadic manifestation of terms in the media and/or their shortterm actualization. First, when studying new special lexis that is functioning in the media, we identified a group of lexis that is perceived as words of special discourse, but functioning exclusively in media discourse — journalistic quasi-terms (quasi... “false, imaginary”), for example, CAR-инженерия (CAR engineering), дамплинг-ион (dumping ion), нейропоэт (neuropoet). Another group of words we identifi ed can be described as terminological newspaperisms, for example, ДНК-детек- тив (DNA detective), CRISPR-эпопея (CRISPR epic), биткоин-лихорадка (bitcoin fever), биткоин-мания (bitcoin-mania), ИИ-пузырь (AI bubble). The second feature we discovered was the fact that media and professional terms and words are used sporadically in media texts, sometimes with high frequency of use over a short period. Thus, based on the collected sample, presumably only about 4–5% of cases are recognized by common language and become the words that “update” the vocabulary of the literary language. These are terms such as графен (graphene), коронавирус (coronavirus), экзопланета (exoplanet), etc. 95% of the sample are cases of terminological noise — journalistic quasi-terms, terminological newspaperisms, terms with a fl ickering frequency. The examples of these include: AI-замок (AI-lock), bitcoin-инвес- тор (bitcoin-investor), CAR-инженерия (CAR-engineering), CRISPR-каскады (CRISPR-cascades), digital-экономика (digital-economy), smart-бизнес (smartbusiness), большой отскок (big rebound), вселесная паутина (omniforestal web), генеративное творчество (generative creativity), ГМ-дрожжи (GM yeast), ИИ-советник (AI-advisor), когнитивное платье (cognitive dress), криспы (crisps), роборыбак (robofi sher). © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences.

The results from the robust linear and machine learning estimators indicate that the returns of the United States Treasury Bonds and the United States Dollar are negatively related to the Green Bond returns. Meanwhile, Gold returns positively affect Green Bond returns. The quantile regression estimations of Machado–Santos Silva also show that these findings are valid in different quantiles.

	abstract = {The issues regarding consumption of energy generated from fossil resources have become particularly relevant in 2022 due to the aggravation of political and economic circumstances causing an energy crisis. Taking into account the existing need to increase the amount of energy produced from renewable energy resources in the European Union, the development of the digital and innovation economy as well as the fact that the mining of crypto-assets can consume large amounts of energy, the study aims to evaluate the impact of the introduction of crypto-assets regulation on the possibilities of using crypto-assets in the renewable energy sector. The results of the NOISE (Needs, Opportunities, Improvements, Strengths, Exceptions) method used indicate the main need – to introduce regulation in an industry where it has not existed before. The most important identified opportunity is to create new crypto-assets and renewable energy business models; improvements are related to transparency of operations and environmental awareness. Main strengths – the introduction of a single, globally new regulatory framework. Regulation’s exceptions are mainly related to even more significant responsibility towards the environment and sustainability issues. Statistical analysis of Bitcoin energy consumption data was performed and it indicates increasing consumption of energy to generate crypto-assets. The share of renewable energy resources used for crypto mining is decreasing, while the use of fossil resources (e.g. natural gas) is increasing. The results of the study, in general, form one of the first scientific opinions on the use of crypto-assets specifically in the renewable energy sector, considering the current legal framework’s development process and indicating future research topics. © 2023 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

	abstract = {The banking sector has been greatly impacted by the technological outburst of the twenty-first century. Bitcoin, the first crypto asset created on block chain technology, has firmly established itself in the financial sector since its introduction in 2009. The market capitalization of uncontrolled crypto assets has grown at an unprecedented rate, posing a threat to the banking industry and the economy. Illegal activities such as terrorist funding and money laundering find refuge in the unregulated world of crypto assets. To keep up with the demands of the computer-savvy Generation Next, banks worldwide have adopted various technologies and improved their service standards. However, central banks continue to follow the traditional system of issuing hard currency bank notes, which do not match the aspirations of most end users. As a result, Central Banks worldwide are currently brainstorming the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This study aims to explore the theoretical aspect, feasibility, and status of CBDC. Four Central Banks have already issued CBDC, while others are in the process of doing so. Block chain under Distributed Ledger Technology is the most suitable and widely accepted platform for issuing CBDC. Robust computer security measures must be established to prevent hacking and ensure monetary stability for CBDC. During the initial stages of CBDC implementation, hard currency banknotes and CBDC will run parallelly until any possible initial hiccups are resolved. CBDC has the potential to boost banking and finance, trade finance, and cross-border international settlements. © 2023 Malque Publishing.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin mixing is a commodity, mostly offered in the underground economy, selling anonymity in the bitcoin ecosystem. Its popularity is rather remarkable, as transactions initiated by its users run through wallets of a centralized service where personal identifiable information is collected in the mixing process, without any prior knowledge of data retention policies. This leaves us to wonder if users resort to strategies to mitigate these risks - like the usage of IP proxy services - or test the service with smaller transactions to identify scam services at 'low' costs. In this paper, we explore unique ground-truth data capturing 15, 574 mixing transactions, initiated by 8, 838 users, totaling US $45M worth of bitcoins mixed through BestMixer between July 2018 and June 2019. We find that user adoption of risk mitigation strategies is limited, while transaction volumes users entrust BestMixer are high and usage is frequent and recurrent - with 23% of users returning. Our analysis shows that only 61% of all transactions used some form of IP address obfuscation - i.e., VPN or VPS usage. We discuss possible explanations for these findings, including how information asymmetries and the role of mixers in the process of cashing-out criminal proceeds might force users to accept the risks associated with bitcoin mixing. Furthermore, we address the implications of our findings for the broader cryptocurrency security ecosystem. © 2023 32nd USENIX Security Symposium, USENIX Security 2023. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to examine the behavioural determinants of Bitcoin trading volume within a cross-country framework of 14 world economies plus the Eurozone. We introduce a basic taxonomy of behavioural indicators, distinguishing between consumer confidence, economic policy uncertainty (EPU), and indicators of financial volatility. Our estimations reveal that the Bitcoin trading volume can be predicted more accurately by EPU than by any other class of indicators. Finally, we identify the COVID-19 shock as a catalyst for a psychologically-driven Bitcoin market and find evidence that Bitcoin was a macro hedging instrument in the pandemic. To obtain our results, we conducted a panel Granger-causality test, employing the Least Squares Dummy Variables (LSDV) estimator. Contrary to previous research, we found that market fundamentals (industrial production and equity market volume) became significant drivers of Bitcoin trading during the pandemic. This conclusion was preserved when we used the LSDV corrected estimator, which is more suitable for panels with a smaller time dimension. Apart from the practical implications for traders, this paper provides researchers with detailed steps for applying Granger causality testing in panel data settings. © 2023 Croatian Operational Research Society.},

	abstract = {Digitalization has permeated all aspects of human lives, economies, and societies. This transformation has been driven by the rapid growth in computing power, storage capabilities, and data transmission infrastructures. These changes have enabled innovations, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smartphones, digitalized homes, (semi) autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and more. Digitalization has further resulted in faster, more effective service delivery by many organizations. The phenomenon of digitalization relies on an increasingly finite supply of resources, such as crude oil, silicon, and energy. Over the past 150 years, humans have consumed as many natural resources as they have consumed in the past 20,000 years. In part, this increasing clip of consumption has been driven by digitalization, as novel, technology-based solutions, such as blockchain, supplant older, slower low-tech solutions, such as books and ledgers, to process data and create value. Digitalization’s demand for resources may be leading us to an environmental abyss. Consider cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, whose electricity consumption is approximately equal to the energy needs of small nations such as Malaysia or Sweden. Such consumption evokes the question, is, “is more digitalization really better, or given the harm to the planet, is this one context where less is more?”. In this paper, we develop a research agenda for understanding the full cost of digitalization and its impact on sustainability. We do so in three parts; first, we offer a crisp definition of sustainability; second, we offer a concise review of the digitalization and sustainability literature; and third, we offer suggestions for research that advances our understanding of how digitalization impacts sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Design/methodology/approach: The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of 138 listed financial firms from four emerging Asian countries for the period 2016–2020. Findings: This study finds that changes in VC values have greater spillover effects on the values of financial stocks in countries which do not recognize the legitimacy of VCs than in countries which do, due to the lack of breadth and depth of the former markets. Moreover, this paper also reports evidence of the greater moderating role of investor attention on this relationship in countries which do not recognize the legitimacy of VCs than in countries which do. Originality/value: Although numerous studies have been conducted on the influence of VCs on stock performance, majority of these studies did not distinguish whether the sample countries being studied actually recognize the legitimacy of VC transactions or not. Moreover, extant literature has not considered the moderating role of investor attention on this relationship. It is the aim of this study to address these research voids by using a refined three-factor theory model of capital asset pricing model incorporating VCs to better represent stock performance in the digital economy era. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aims to investigate the bibliometric characteristics of existing studies published in Scopus-indexed journals to comprehend the most recent movements in Cryptocurrency publishing, the primary themes in cryptocurrency, and factors impacting them, and analyze the Citation network of the cryptocurrency based on the previously published Scopus indexed journals. Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a new asset class, and individuals and organizations often face investment decisions related to cryptocurrencies. Decision science techniques, such as risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and behavioral economics, can be applied to assess the risks and potential returns associated with cryptocurrency investments. These techniques help investors make informed decisions based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market conditions. Design/Methodology: Both citation network analysis and author co-citation analysis are used in our analysis based on Cryptocurrency articles written in 2019 from 2013 to 2022 with top titles including Current Issues in Auditing and International Review of Financial Analysis to find both keywords and track Bitcoin-related cited works. The research also uses VOS Viewer and R in the analysis to visualize both data networks and spread Findings: In our analysis, we find that Cryptocurrency, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, and Distributed Ledger Technology were the most commonly-used terms, studying Cryptocurrency in emerging nations is difficult due to significant social disparities and poor reading levels, Guglielmo Maria Caporale is the most cited author in this area with three works and 147 Citations up to the moment of our study, the most Cryptocurrency-focused institution is the Sumy State institution in Ukraine, which has produced two papers up to the moment of our study, and India gets the most publications in the area, followed by the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, and so on, and the United Arab Emirates comes in last place regarding cryptocurrency-related publications. Our study claims no consensus on defining cryptocurrency, leading authors to use varying terms, words such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and distributed ledger technology are often used equally, and cryptocurrency research has had a significant uptick over the past decade and is increasing at an impressive rate. Practical Implications: The research findings have several practical implications for cryptocurrency, specifically regarding Bitcoin patterns that benefit researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders. For instance, researchers can utilize the study's information to explore new areas and understand the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency research. Policymakers can leverage the insights to develop effective policies and initiatives, enhancing regulation, risk assessment, and consumer protection in cryptocurrency ecosystems. The research contributes to a broader understanding of cryptocurrency's dynamics, societal impact, and implications for finance, economy, and society. This knowledge aids informed decision-making for individuals, businesses, and organizations involved with cryptocurrency. Originality: Cryptocurrency citation network analysis has been used in this study. It explains why some writers are cited extensively around the globe while others are cited so rarely locally. Indications are that the worldwide citation is much greater. However, the number of local to worldwide citations is low and could be improved by prioritizing better local citations. Therefore, the study concludes that scholarly interest in cryptocurrency is new and has excellent potential for future research. © 2023 Hindawi Limited. All rights reserved.},

We created a novel approach, named quantile mediation analysis, which blends mediation regression with quantile regression, enabling us to explore the influence of Brent crude oil on carbon dioxide emissions by considering the mediating impact of Bitcoin. According to the findings from using our new approach, the impact of Brent crude oil on carbon dioxide emissions is partly mediated by Bitcoin, and the association between Brent crude oil and carbon dioxide emissions involves both direct and indirect effects. Since the carbon dioxide generated by the extraction of crude oil and Bitcoin has a great impact on the environment, accelerating the use of clean energy technologies to reduce our reliance on crude oil should be the direction that the cryptocurrency industry ought to pursue in the future. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Four Asian Tigers are often characterised by their surge of economic growth, and have come to represent rapid industrialisation albeit with a dash of authoritarianism. Indeed, the economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Chinese Taipei had undergone an unprecedented level of development in an extremely short span of time following decolonialisation, causing the World Bank to dub them “The East Asian Miracle”. Yet, as the world moves into the digital age, new hurdles present themselves on the horizon for these mammoths to overcome. Of these, one of the tallest, and perhaps most unpredictable, seems to be the increasingly disruptive nature of decentralised digital assets (“DDA”). Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, the use, development and activity of DDAs has been growing at an unprecedented rate across the globe. With a global market cap of over $1 Trillion USD in crypto-assets alone, DDAs undoubtedly would play a significant role in the modern global economy. Yet, despite the huge potential around these assets, policy-makers have become particularly wary of these DDAs. The emphasis on their decentralised nature has presented them as a way for users to undermine the traditional regulatory mechanisms. Particularly here, DDAs have gained notoriety as tools for assisting in money-laundering, and bypassing state-imposed economic sanctions. Studies by the International Federation of Accountants here note 5 common ways these occurs: (1) predicating crime, (2) converting illegally obtained digital assets into tangible assets, (3) hiding transactions through anonymised services, (4) layering numerous exchanges of assets from tangible to intangible to mask transactions, and (5) the integration and legitimisation of income. In light of these concerns, regional harmonised approaches seem to be taking centre stage. In Europe, significant discussion has been placed around the recent Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. On the other side of the Atlantic, the United States seems to be working on similar provisions, following the recent leak of the draft bill regulating DeFi and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (‘DAO”). Yet, such a harmonised approach seems to be lacking in Asia. Instead, competition between the Asian Tigers to attract investors has resulted in starkly individualised approaches among them, each looking to out-position the other to take advantage of these new developments. However, this disharmonised and fragmented approach ultimately led to cracks appearing in the regulatory firewall, often through policy oversights. This paper will thus take a comparative, and law-economics based approach towards the law governing DDAs across these 4 high-income economies, particularly the laws governing transnational anti-money laundering mechanisms, and the place of DDAs in the law of sanctions among these nations. It primarily considers this from the perspectives of DDAs as a tool, and their impacts on how nation-states craft anti-money laundering laws (“AML”). While it ultimately concludes that the fragmented approach is acceptable given the current situation, greater cooperation between both private and public stakeholders is imperative towards the development of the law of sanctions. In doing a comparative analysis within these economies, this paper looks at 2 key areas within AML on digital assets. Firstly, it considers the extent of which regulatory mechanisms (such as disclosure of identities) interact with these DDAs within the local economies. Then, it considers how sanctions target DDAs, and the relevant AML laws. A further dimension that is also explored is the role of Virtual Asset Service Providers (“VASPs”) within these economies, and the nature of the set of rights which are attached to these DDAs. It then discusses how this domestic legislation would interact with the growing body of international law instruments that have been in the works, including the guidelines introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”), and the United Nations International Institute for the Unification of Private Law. It is then argued here that the crux of the interaction between the law of sanctions and domestic legislation on DDAs lies in the conversion between DDAs and tangible assets. The role of AMLs should then look to combat the conversion of “dirty” assets as a whole. Ultimately, the comparative analysis concludes with a brief discussion of mechanisms to strengthen and, to an extent, harmonise international laws in this field. Firstly, the doctrine of comity between nations should once more be reaffirmed and strengthened. This ensures mutual recognition of regulatory attempts between these economies mutually strengthening AML legislation through the Courts in a bottom-up, but also a top-down regulatory perspective. This similarly extends to provisions around regional cooperation across the private sector, and mechanisms where these economies can implement to encourage such cooperation. Secondly, a discussion is had about the use of corporate standards for future regulatory work; concerns that AML might be too reactive, or “out-of-date” is rather prominent. Hence, futureproofing through working with various stakeholders to develop comprehensive frameworks to encapsulate the relevant features and novelties with DDAs would prove invaluable. Such would then allow these economies to fully utilise DDAs to their full potential while ensuring compliance with the law of sanctions. © 2023, University of Torino. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The present study conducts a dynamic conditional cross-correlation and time–frequency correlation analyses between cryptocurrency and equity markets in both advanced and emerging economies. The purpose of the study is twofold. First, the study investigates the presence of the pure (narrow) form of financial contagion between cryptocurrency and stock markets in both advanced and emerging economies, during the black swan event of the COVID-19 crisis. Second, the study examines the hedging and safe-haven properties of cryptocurrencies against equity markets, before and during periods of financial upheaval triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two econometric models are used: (1) the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH and (2) the wavelet analysis models. Using the DCC GARCH model, the study found the evidence of high conditional correlations between cryptocurrency and equity markets. The high conditional correlation was mostly detected in periods of financial turmoil corresponding to the first quarter and the second quarter of 2020. The increase in conditional correlation during periods of financial upheaval (compared to a tranquil period) indicates the presence of the pure form of financial contagion. The wavelet cross-correlation analysis showed the evidence of positive cross-correlation between the Bitcoin and the equity markets during period of financial turmoil. The cross-correlation was identified in both short and long (coarse) scales. In short scales, the equity markets lead the cryptocurrency market, while the cryptocurrency market leads equity markets in coarse scales. The findings of the present study revealed that the degree of interdependence between cryptocurrency and equity markets has substantially increased during the COVID-19 period, and this has negated the safe-haven and hedging benefits of cryptocurrencies over equity markets. © 2023 The Author(s).

To date, it has not been clear what impacts its ongoing growth will have, if any, on wealth distribution. Here, we propose to identify all forms of contemporary wealth into two classes: ‘distinguishable’ or ‘identical’. Traditional tangible moneys are all distinguishable. Financial assets and cryptocurrencies, such as bank deposits and Bitcoin, are boson-like, while non-fungible tokens are fermion-like. We derived their ownership-based distributions in a unified manner. Each class follows essentially the Poisson or the geometric distribution. We contrast their distinct features such as Gini coefficients. Furthermore, aggregating different kinds of wealth corresponds to a weighted convolution where the number of banks matters and Bitcoin follows Bose–Einstein distribution. Our proposal opens a new avenue to understand the deepened inequality in modern economy, which is based on the statistical physics property of wealth rather than the individual ability of owners. We call for verifications with real data. Copyright © 2023 Kim and Park.},

	abstract = {During times of technological development, many aspects of everyday activities have been digitalized while traditional forms of payments have stepped back in the name of more innovative methods such as cryptocurrencies. This article focuses on analysing the emergence, functionality, and future role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. By interpreting the theoretical aspects of money, the emergence of cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology, the authors tried to determine whether cryptocurrencies have the potential to become the money of the future. In the article, the analysis of cryptocurrencies functioning in the modern world focuses on the role of technological development and innovations in their use and popularity. SWOT and speculative analyses of cryptocurrencies, which have been touted as the money of the future, were also carried out. The results obtained from the research show that cryptocurrencies have many advantages over traditional payment methods. Elimination of intermediaries, low transaction costs, safe storage of data, limited increase in monetary supply, globalization, and privacy are stated as the most important of these opportunities. In addition, energy use, inaccessibility without the internet, high volatility, and cyber-Attacks were seen as the most important threats and weaknesses. When developments in the world follow, it can be seen that there are many blockchain-based opportunities or threats. Despite this, blockchain technology offers great opportunities. As a result, countries and individuals should turn to this technology now to benefit more in the future. At this point, it is very important for all other educational institutions, especially universities, to implement educational programs that will meet the needs of the age. © 2023 Optica Publishing Group.},

The portfolios of investors who made decisions in uncertain conditions have been affected by these fluctuations that have caused volatility in the stock market's indexes. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the Fear Index (FI), the Dollar Index, and Bitcoin on the volatility of the Borsa Istanbul 100 Index (BIST). Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) time series analysis was used for the study, which revealed that the Dollar Index has no effect on volatility, while the FI was found to have an effect on volatility both in the short and long runs. In addition, Bitcoin was determined to have an effect on volatility only in the long run. When the period of the data used is examined, the outbreak of the Russia–Ukraine war in February 2022 is thought to be the reason for the increase in the FI. It can be assumed that the decisions of investors to invest in the BIST were adversely affected by the war as a natural consequence of this, and investors who ceased investing in the BIST index opted to invest elsewhere. © 2023 AESS Publications.

So, the present study attempts to investigate the static and dynamic connexions between liquid and futures markets of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple XRP and Bitcoin Cash from June 2018 to June 2022. The connexion between their liquid and futures markets is first investigated using unconditional correlation, Johansen’s cointegration, vector error correction and Wald’s block exogeneity. Their estimates discern connexions encompassing significant long-run relationships between their liquid and futures markets; momentous unidirectional long-run causality from their futures market to liquid market; and momentous bidirectional short-run causality from their liquid market to futures market and from their futures market to liquid market. The present treatise encompasses methodological advancement in the investigation of interconnectedness between these markets by employing a dynamic conditional correlation model and a wavelet transform framework. Their discerned estimates indicate that the markets of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash have only momentous long-run perseverance, lingering and spillover effects of shocks’ sway on conditional correlations. However, there is momentous short- and long-run perseverance, lingering and spillover effects in the case of Ripple XRP. The wavelet coherence analysis also confirms these results by indicating a bidirectional short-run causal relation and a long-run positive comovement between liquid returns and futures returns of these cryptocurrencies. These discernments may help investors, portfolio managers and policymakers to enhance hedging effectiveness through optimal portfolio allocation and monitor financial contagion to attain and sustain financial stability in economies. © 2023 MDI.},

By applying advanced econometric techniques, this research empirically tests the dynamic impacts of Bitcoin trading, economic growth, and energy use on CO2 emissions in the top 20 Bitcoin-trading emerging market economies from 2013 to 2020, highlighting results on the existence of cross-section dependence, slope heterogeneity, and unit roots in the panel data. Moreover, Bitcoin trading, economic growth, and energy use have a significantly positive effect on CO2 emissions from a long-term perspective. Findings further show that CO2 emissions have a bi-causal correlation with all three determinants. Relevant implications are offered as follows. For academic researchers, cross-section dependence and slope heterogeneity are important considerations, and ignoring them would lead to significantly biased inferences. Emerging market governments should introduce eco-friendly technology for Bitcoin trading, modify the present extensive mode of economic growth, and guard against unsustainable energy consumption. © 2023},

Its development has led to the emergence of a huge number of additional institutions, financial instruments, and new forms of interaction between people in our society. The article aims to deepen the theoretical and practical provisions of the characterization and development of cryptocurrency as a phenomenon of the modern world economy. The study applied the method of cognition of phenomena and processes, which allows us to consider them in development and interrelation, as well as to identify established patterns and trends. In the course of proving the key theoretical positions, deductive and inductive methods have been applied. Dialectical and systemic-structural approaches were used to clarify certain provisions. At the theoretical level, in addition to the above, we used such methods as conceptual (terminological), formalization, and axiomatic, since some theoretical statements were accepted without evidence. The synthetic method was used to summarize various subjective ideas and theories of researchers in the field of economics. The analytical method was used to analyze scientific sources on economics in the economic research space. The practical significance of the research results lies in the possibility of their use for further development of theoretical and practical approaches to forecasting the impact of cryptocurrency on the global economy in the future.

	abstract = {The emergence of the covid-19 health crisis, in this advanced technological era where connections between markets, nations, and economies have grown stronger than ever before, the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic quickly had an impact on both physical and digital financial assets. The Chinese financial market experienced the first consequences of the covid-19 pandemic, then spilled over to other financial markets, including those for cryptocurrencies and the precious metals. This study examines the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the volatilities of the dynamics of bitcoin and gold. Both assets share some characteristics, such as online trading platforms, however, gold is a tangible financial asset unlike bitcoin, which is digitally generated without any physical form. This study argues that the similarities and differences between bitcoin and gold play major roles in how the covid-19 crisis affected their respective dynamics. Using daily data ranging from 9/22/2014 to 1/ 31/2023 and employing ARMA as the mean equation for GARCH model, the impact of the health crisis (covid-19) is examined on the volatilities of the prices and volumes of bitcoin and gold. Empirical evidence points out that, the pandemic has a symmetric impact on the volatilities of bitcoin and gold price returns, causing them to be more volatile. The impact of the covid-19 observed on the volume returns of the assets, however, is asymmetrical. The empirical results give evidence to the role that the vital differences existing between these assets played during the covid-19 pandemic. Copyright: © 2023 Badshah et al.

We used panel quantile regression by utilizing extreme lower quantiles (i.e., 1%, 2.5%, 5%). It will only be recognized as a safe haven asset if it is negatively correlated with another asset during extreme adverse shocks. The data spans from 23 February 2021 - 25 July 2022 which covered the five largest economies in Europe and Asia (i.e., Germany, France, the UK, China, and Japan). The findings indicate that gold only acted as a safe haven asset for wheat, SI, and IS during the Russia-Ukraine war.

	abstract = {Numerous economic and financial crises, particularly the present crisis in the healthcare sector, have pushed major shock spillover channels over stock marketplaces. This research studied how the shock spillover system is affected by three significant factors: Bitcoins, unpredictability, and the China stock market between 2014 and 2021. While much earlier empirical research has looked at risk dispersion in different financial markets, this article will zero in on green markets. This investigation seeks to accomplish something that has never been done before: determine whether or not green commodities, Bitcoin, and uncertainty impact the performance of the China stock market. The following are significant results based on a quantile vector autoregressive (VAR) connection. (i) A static spillover system indicates that information was widely shared across markets during intense market circumstances. (ii) The global green economy and clean energy marketplaces are the primary sources of knowledge spillover in adverse market conditions. This research elucidates the asymmetrical influence of green products, Bitcoin, and market volatility in China. This is vital due to the dynamic nature of international and regional connections. Recent studies have shown that shock spillovers are excellent for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), uncertainty indices, and global carbon indexes, but bad for most eco-friendly products. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Libra based on blockchain technology have set off a wave of digital economy, which can ensure the verifiability and integrity of transactions through digital signatures, in which the private key ensures the ownership of currency assets, if the private key was lost or stolen, the security of cryptocurrency assets will be significantly threatened. Compared with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), Edwards curves digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) has the advantages of faster calculation speed, smaller key and signature space, and is widely used in the signature of Libra transactions. However, as a deterministic signature algorithm, it is vulnerable to differential fault attacks resulting in key loss and leakage. It is a challenge that how to resist this kind of attack and design a provably secure EdDSA signature. Therefore, we firstly define the security properties are firstly defined that the digital signature scheme against differential fault attacks that must be meet, and differential fault attack technology is utilized to cryptanalyze the EdDSA signature algorithm, and an EdDSA signature scheme that resists differential fault attacks is proposed, and it is proved that the scheme satisfies the existence of unforgeable under adaptive selection message attack (EUF-CMA) and resistance to differential fault attack. In order to reduce the risk of signature private key leakage, with the help of Paillier homomorphic encryption technology, we design a two-party cooperative EdDSA signature scheme against differential fault attack is designed, and prove the security of the scheme based on the universally composable (UC) security model is proved. Finally, we implement the two-party cooperative ECDSA signature algorithm and the two-party cooperative EdDSA signature algorithm against differential fault attack are implemented, and the implementation demonstrates that the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The study used time series quarterly data on bitcoin, financial stability, inflation rate, real GDP, economic volatility uncertainty, exchange rate, and market volatility index for the period 2015Q1–2022Q4. The robustness of the findings was confirmed by the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and canonical cointegration regression (CCR). The study results demonstrated that an increase in cryptocurrency investments will affect the financial stability of India significantly. Each 1% increase in the cryptocurrency would reduce the financial stability by 5% approximately. However, there was a marginal effect of cryptocurrency on economic growth. The results also found that exchange rate volatility and inflationary pressure would also deteriorate the financial stability of the country. Furthermore, the results also identified positive and significant cointegration between economic growth and financial stability. Due to most transactions in the economy being done through the financial system, it is paramount for economic growth. Going forward, aggressive monetary policy tightening, volatility in capital flows and exchange rates, de-anchoring of inflation expectations, faltering in the economic recovery, disruptions due to global supply chains and climate change will be the major risks to the financial stability and economic growth of India. © Shrikant Panigrahi, 2023.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin has become quite known after the 2008 economic crisis and the COVID-19 health crisis. For some, these cryptocurrencies constitute rebellion against the existing system as governments encourage uncontrolled expansions in the money supply; for some others, it is a quick source of income. Undeniably, the volume of the crypto money market has grown considerably in recent years, regardless of the reasoning of the people who invest and trade in this field. At this point, one of the most important questions to be investigated is “what variables have caused the tremendous growth in the crypto money quantities in recent years?” This study tests the assumption that changes in cryptocurrencies are affected by changes in national currencies. Thus, the Bitcoin price is the dependent variable, and M1 monetary supply changes in the USA, European Union and Japanese economies are considered independent variables. The variables in this study were tested using the time-varying Granger causality method. The results obtained from this study confirm the philosophy of Bitcoin's emergence and the possibility that it can be a hedge against the inflationary effects of money, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

Because of its potential to combat corruption and help the impoverished, among other things, this technology is worth investing in. Any kind of transaction, such as the sale of a home or a stock, may be tracked nearly instantly. Sustainable development is at the heart of today's modern world. Technology like this may be useful in the pursuit of sustainability, which involves improving the here and now without jeopardizing the future. To be really useful, though, this innovation requires a robust digital governance structure. The purpose of this article is to investigate Blockchain Technology as a tool for promoting long-term, environmentally friendly growth in India, and to identify contexts where it may be particularly useful. How the Indian economy may adopt this technology and incorporate it into its system to achieve Sustainable Development is the topic of my paper.

	abstract = {Research Summary: This abductive study investigates how management occurs without managerial authority as part of a previously unseen organizational form—the decentralized platform with an independent market value. Our mixed-methods study of the cryptocurrency industry draws on fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) to analyze archival and interview data and offer new theory on how decentralized platforms coordinate activities to grow in an early-stage, before network effects kick in. We find that, in the absence of a central authority, platforms coordinate activities with three mechanisms, namely decentralized (a) algorithmic coordination, (b) social coordination, and (c) goal coordination. Our QCA treat these mechanisms as explanatory conditions and, using a representative sample of 20 cryptocurrency platforms, reveal which configurations of decentralized coordination mechanisms nurture, or hinder, early-stage platform growth. Managerial Summary: Firms operate around a managerial hierarchy that distributes tasks, resources, information, and rewards to organizational members who pursue common goals as contract-bound employees. From 2009, a new organizational form, called the “decentralized platform,” emerged and diffused without relying on hierarchy nor managerial authority—and without having to employ anyone. The most prominent decentralized platform, Bitcoin, has millions of users, thousands of contributors, and a market valuation never achieved before by an organization without a CEO nor shareholders. This study explicates how this unprecedented level of organizational decentralization functions in practice. We foreshadow implications for the digital economy, wherein “Web3” innovations, such as non-fungible tokens and DAOs, have already shifted the orchestrating role played by platforms in capitalist societies. © 2022 The Authors.

The study considered 13 safe haven assets across the world’s largest economies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GARCH (1,1) and the threshold GARCH models were applied. The results obtained from the model estimation test showed that COVID-19 and oil price had a negative effect on some safe haven assets. International stock has less volatility. The result also revealed that crypto currencies (Bitcoin, Tether, Etherium), stocks (Shanghai stock exchange), currencies (US dollars, Swiss franc, and pounds), precious metal (silver) and government securities (T-bond and T-bill) were less volatile but COVID-19 pandemic triggered higher volatility on precious metal (gold) and stocks (S&P500, CAC40).

	abstract = {Significant changes in the financial system are prompted by the growth of the national economy, particularly as a form of payment. The means evolved from barter to things or commodities to metal and paper as the base materials for money before arriving at barter. With such significant changes, there is also a need for a transformation in the world of education in order to welcome technological advancements and one way to survive the changes in the increasingly rapid digital era. As the economic need increases, trade transaction methods shift from traditional to internet-based. One of the necessary international online payment options is bitcoin. For many applications where payments are modest and instantaneous approval is required, Bitcoin is inappropriate because of the high transaction fees and long confirmation periods. As a result, despite the introduction of numerous rival cryptocurrencies to address these problems, the Bitcoin network continues to be the most extensively used payment method. Unquestionably, new finding of this research that effectively address the problems of high transaction costs and transaction verification times are needed if the company is to benefit from its user network. The Lightning Network (LN), which makes use of off-chain bidirectional payment channels between participants, is one of the most recent payment network concepts to be proposed. © Henderi1, Qurotul Aini, Danny Manongga, Irwan Sembiring, Dwi Apriliasari.},

	abstract = {The decentralized financial (DeFi) market has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, transforming how people access, manage, and exchange digital financial services. DeFi essentially refers to decentralized economic activities facilitated by blockchain technology. The tokenization of real-world assets contributes to the popularity of digital financial services, enabling unlimited sets of innovative ways to represent assets and interchange them. The DeFi peer-To-peer nature has been seen as a disruptor for traditional financial services due to its flexibility, openness, programmability, financial inclusion, censorship-resistant, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. To better understand the evolving DeFi ecosystem and its potential, analyzing transaction data using social network analysis (SNA) can offer valuable insights. The main goal of this research is to identify influential participants and uncover groups of related transactions, providing valuable information to market participants, regulators, and innovators on how to enhance the stability of DeFi and reduce risks. Three DeFi token-based Ethereum protocols have been analyzed: Dai (DAI), Uniswap (UNI), and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The study unveiled key players associated with each token by applying centrality calculations. Additionally, the modularity metric is employed to identify transaction clusters formed within each token, shedding light on the patterns and relationships within the network of the token economy.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid spread of cryptocurrencies is one of the most relevant trends today. One of the significant risks of their spread is the increase in energy consumption, which has a negative impact on the environment due to carbon emissions. This requires the development of a scientific toolkit for assessing relationships and predicting the impact of cryptocurrencies on energy consumption, which is the aim of this paper. With the correlational regression analysis, the model of the dependence of spending on IT sector, energy consumption of Bitcoin, Ethereum and global capitalization of the cryptocurrency market was conducted, based on statistical data from Statista.com, Сoinmarketcap.com and International Data Corporation. To check the possible relationship, tests for the adequacy of the results obtained (Fisher’s test, Student’s t-test) confirmed the correctness of coefficients for independent variables. The results showed a significant direct correlation (Multiple R is 95%) of spending on IT sector, energy consumption and global capitalization of the cryptocurrency market. The established relationships allowed predicting that Bitcoin energy consumption may reach 142 Terawatt hours per year in 2026. And its impact on environment by mining in 2022 was at least 27.4 Mt of CO2 emission. As a proposal, a conclusion was made on the expediency of linking mining to the use of certain sources of electricity production, such as “residual” natural gas, nuclear power, renewable energy sources. The obtained results and conclusions may be used as a basis for political decisions in the field of energy efficiency and climate change mitigation. © The author(s) 2023.},

Different economies across the globe have seen a lot of growth of cryptocurrency over the time and bitcoin especially has seen a growth of 1100% that is why time series analysis of cryptocurrency is of immense significance. Time series analysis can be referred to as the process of taking into consideration a sequence of different points which are observed over a specific time interval. A large number of people start investing into cryptocurrencies without having any knowledge or analyzing the cryptocurrency market because of the hype it has these days and suffer huge losses so designing a model which can predict accurately as to how different cryptocurrencies would behave on basis of previous record can be very helpful and it can help some people in making profit rather than suffering loss. This paper presents a comparative overview of different algorithms like RNN, Linear Regression, GARCH, and ARIMA which can be used for time series analysis and concludes as to which algorithm is best suitable for time series analysis by considering different parameters like RMSE, MAE, etc., Besides this, it also analyzes the different factors which affect the prices of cryptocurrency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The advent of e-commerce has led to increased online transactions facilitated by e-payment systems, which can fall prey to opportunistic hackers. Cryptocurrencies have been pegged as a solution to this security issue. However, little is currently known around consumer propensity to use a cryptocurrency as an e-payment option, particularly within a developing economy. The investigated factors that could influence user adoption were based on literature and tested on a South African representative sample of 814 respondents. Of the factors identified from literature, the study found that “perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use,” “self-efficacy,” “awareness,” “trust,” and “security” have the most significant influence on South African consumers adopting a cryptocurrency as an e-payment system. © 2023 IGI Global.

The decentralized nature of the blockchain makes its convergence with eGovernment suitable for enhancing transparent and trust-worthy public processes and can be used to facilitate the efficient management of activities of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), accessible through the intervention programs of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as the Official Development Assistance (ODA) given to developing countries. This scoping review paper presents insights to enable Donor Aid providers and International Cooperation Agencies that are preparing to carry out new intervention projects to optimize their activities, by increasing the transparency and trustworthiness of their transactions. This study will also serve as a guide for researchers who wish to embark on evidence synthesis on the impact of blockchain technology and eGovernment convergence on the optimization of ODA activities in developing countries. Results from this study reveal that even though the blockchain technology has great prospects and can be applied as proposed: 1.

	abstract = {Over the last few years, cryptocurrencies have become a new alternative exchange currency for the global economy. Due to the high volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies, forecasting the price movements is considered a very complicated challenge in the world of finance. Technical analysis indicators are one of the prediction tools which are widely used by analysts. These indicators, which are explored from the historical prices and volumes, might have useful information on price dynamics in the market. Meanwhile, with the new advances in artificial intelligence techniques, like long short-term memory (LSTM), which is able to keep the track of long-term dependencies; there is the extensive application of deep neural networks for predicting nonstationary and nonlinear time series. This study provides a forecasting method for cryptocurrencies by applying an LSTM multi-input neural network to investigate the prediction power of the lags of technical analysis indicators as the inputs to forecast the price returns of the three cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) that have the highest market capitalization. The results illustrate that the proposed method helps the investors to make more reliable decisions by significantly improving the prediction accuracy against the random walk over the maximum trading time of BTC, ETH, and XRP datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies are said to be very risky, and so are the currencies of emerging economies, including the South African rand. The steady rise in the movement of South Africans’ investments between the rand and BitCoin warrants an investigation as to which of the two currencies is riskier. In this paper, the Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) model is employed to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) for the two exchange rates, BitCoin/US dollar (BitCoin) and the South African rand/US dollar (ZAR/USD). The estimated risk measures are used to compare the riskiness of the two exchange rates. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method is used to find the optimal parameters of the GPD model. The higher extreme value index estimate associated with the BTC/USD when compared with the ZAR/USD estimate, suggests that the BTC/USD is riskier than the ZAR/USD. The computed VaR estimates for losses of $0.07, $0.09, and $0.16 per dollar invested in the BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99% compared to the ZAR/USD’s $0.02, $0.02, and $0.03 at the respective levels of significance, confirm that BitCoin is riskier than the rand. The ES (average losses) of $0.11, $0.13, and $0.21 per dollar invested in the BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99% compared to the ZAR/USD’s $0.02, $0.02, and $0.03 at the respective levels of significance further confirm the higher risk associated with BitCoin. Model adequacy is confirmed using the Kupiec test procedure. These findings are helpful to risk managers when making adequate risk-based capital requirements more rational between the two currencies. The argument is for more capital requirements for BitCoin than for the South African rand. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Central Bank Digital currencies (CBDCs) are one of the most important trends of the late 2010s, which can radically change the role of financial regulators in the financial services industry. The purpose of the study is to identify the distinctive characteristics of the central bank’s digital currencies in comparison with other forms of money and determine the possible impact of them on the economy of a country. The study reveals the process underlying blockchain transactions and the main risks of cryptocurrencies such as high volatility, anonymity of transactions contributing to the development of illegal activities, a threat to the welfare of citizens and the financial stability of the economy. At the same time, the introduction of CBDCs potentially promises to significantly reshape payment infrastructure at both the domestic and international levels. We define a central bank digital currency as central bank money in a digital form that will be used along with cash and non-cash money, performing all the functions of money and being equivalent to all three forms of the same currency (1 digital ruble = 1 ruble in cash = 1 non-cash ruble on the deposit accounts). During the research 14 core features of CBDCs have been identified, covering the CBDC instrument, the underlying system, and the broader institutional framework in which they exist. On the Russian market the question of issuing a digital ruble becomes particularly relevant as the share of non-cash trade turnover in total consumer spending is constantly growing. In the course of the study, the authors identified the main factors that can assess the degree of readiness of businesses and citizens to implement digital ruble, according to which it can be recognized that there is a high potential for the adoption of innovative financial technologies in Russia. It is worth noting that in February 2022, the Bank of Russia started assessing the possibility of issuing a digital ruble and conducting tests. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

One of the most popular tools in digital economy activities is cryptocurrency, which has led to a rise in digital awareness among people who are more inclined to live their lives electronically and digitally. The aim of this study is to explore the problems and prospects associated with the usage of cryptocurrency and identify ways to address these issues using the governmental roadmap in China and Cambodia. The methods employed in this study include descriptive, explanatory, and comparative analyses. The results demonstrate that the adoption of cryptocurrency presents both opportunities and threats to the Chinese and Cambodian economies. These opportunities and threats need to be carefully considered and balanced by policymakers and stakeholders. The conclusion drawn from the study is that there is still no official acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrency by the Chinese and Cambodian governments. This is primarily due to the fact that the risks and challenges associated with cryptocurrencies are deemed to be greater than the foreseeable opportunities, making them difficult to manage effectively. © Liv S., Awori O.S., Fedyunin A.S., 2023.},

While claims that data is the new oil typically assume digital technologies to be clean, renewable and sustainable, an infrastructural approach reveals the vast quantities of oil and other fossil fuels necessary for digital capitalism, therefore repudiating claims that data can grow exponentially with no material costs.

	abstract = {The convergence of blockchain technology and edge intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in the realm of smart cities, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance sustainability. This paper presents a comprehensive review and prospective analysis of this convergence, shedding light on its potential to revolutionize urban environments. We commence with an exploration of the fundamental components of blockchain technology, emphasizing its core principles of decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms. Simultaneously, we trace the historical evolution of blockchain from its origins with Bitcoin to its broad applications in diverse domains. In the context of edge intelligence, we examine how this paradigm shift decentralizes data processing, enabling real-time decision-making and enhancing data security. We elucidate its key components, such as edge devices and analytics algorithms, while highlighting its critical role in reshaping the urban landscape. The crux of this paper lies in the convergence of blockchain and edge intelligence, where we explore its profound implications for the sustainability of smart cities. From efficient energy management and waste reduction to improved transportation and green infrastructure, this convergence empowers smart cities to optimize resource usage, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the quality of life for their residents. Through a prospective analysis, we anticipate emerging trends and innovations that will shape the future of smart city sustainability, including AI integration, 5G connectivity, and circular economy initiatives.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the impact of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and Ripple) on the gold, WTI, VIX index, G7 and the BRICS index before and during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This research analyzes the impact of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and Ripple) on the gold, WTI, VIX index, G7 and the BRICS index before and during COVID-19, using the quantile regression approach for the 2016–2020 period. In addition, to catch long- and short-run asymmetries of cryptocurrencies on aforementioned dependent variables, an asymmetric nonlinear co-integration (nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag [NARDL]) approach is applied. Findings: The result of the quantile regression shows that in a high market, which corresponds to the 90th quantile, the FTSE MIB, CAC40, SSE, BSE 30, and BVSP stock market showed a statistically insignificant negative coefficient, on the Bitcoin price. In a middle and low markets, which correspond to the 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5th quantiles, the BVSP, FTSE MIB, S&P/TSX, SSE and Nikkei stock markets show statistically significant and positive on Bitcoin. Evidence from the NARDL shows a statistically significant positive impact of cryptocurrencies on the gold, WTI, VIX index, G7 and BRICS indices before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: These results can provide investors with valuable analysis and information and help them make the best decisions and adopt the best strategies. Therefore, future investigations may concentrate and examine the monetary and governmental policies to be adapted to face the COVID-19 pandemic’s dangerous effects on both the society and the economy. For this reason, investors should take this into account when making their asset allocation decisions. Moreover, the portfolio managers, such as index funds, may consider few eligible cryptocurrencies for their inclusion into the portfolio. However, the speculators present in both stock and crypto markets may opt for a spread strategy to improve their portfolio returns. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In fact, the protagonist of both novels, Jean Detrez, is a senior official of the European Commission and expert in “strategic foresight”, writing reports on the collective future. At a time when the power of virtualisation and distancing are at their peak, Toussaint questions himself and us on sensitive topics: what are the real powers of the European Commission and the increasingly digital and inward-looking world, which seems to ignore the difference between a collective and individual future? Nevertheless, the link between the two novels seems to dwell in the power of emotions. This paper aims to study Toussaint’s “secrets d’écriture” (C’est vous l’écrivain) in order to focus on how power is staged in both novels. By addressing the dialogue between literature and Belgian history, we also aim to demonstrate how Brussels’ history ends up deeply intertwined with Europe’s history, almost sidelining the history of Belgium altogether. © 2023 Brepols Publishers.

However, reduced frictions in global capital flows could also result in more capital flow and exchange rate volatility, which is of particular concern for emerging market economies.There will be greater competition among fiat currencies and certain private currencies such as stablecoins in their roles as mediums of exchange for payment and settlement of domestic as well as cross-border transactions. However, neither the advent of CBDCs nor the lowering of barriers to international financial flows will do much on their own to reorder the international monetary system or the balance of power among major currencies. Currencies such as the US dollar that are dominant stores of value will remain so because that dominance rests not just on the issuing country’s economic size and financial market depth, but also on a strong institutional foundation that is essential for maintaining investors’ trust in a currency. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {This study provides novel insight to the role of cryptocurrency mining activities on fossil fuel price dynamics with a particular focus on the coal market. Despite the global climate agenda, coal remains a key energy source for economic growth as it is the dominant fuel for power generation globally. At the same time, the unprecedented growth in the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies has put extra pressure on this market as the mining process consumes vast amounts of energy fuelled predominantly by coal. Hypothesizing that there is a causal link in the direction of coal prices from Bitcoin mining activities due to its effect on electricity consumption, we utilize static and time-varying Granger causality tests to explore the causal linkages between Bitcoin electricity consumption and coal prices as the issue has significant implications for economic development. The results reveal a time-varying causal link from the coal price to Bitcoin mining electricity consumption, suggesting that the coal price is in fact a constraint on mining activities. At the same time, as hypothesized, the evidence in the opposite direction is found to be even stronger, suggesting that electricity consumption from Bitcoin mining activities impacts the coal price. This interplay suggests that electricity consumption from Bitcoin mining activities may be larger than current estimates, highlighting the importance of policy mechanisms to mitigate the possible negative effects on the economy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Can blockchain innovation promote total factor productivity? Based on the blockchain patent data of Chinese-listed firms from 2012 to 2020, we show that blockchain innovation activities can improve the total factor productivity (TFP) of enterprises and verify its robustness using instrumental variable approach, system GMM and Heckman’s two-step selection method. Results of mediation effect model show that enterprises’ blockchain innovation activities mainly improve TFP through three channels: alleviating financing constraints, reducing supply chain concentration and inefficient investment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that electronic digital data processing blockchain patents have the highest practical value, while financial blockchain innovation inhibits the improvement of TFP in China. Blockchain innovation can bring positive effects on the TFP of manufacturing enterprises and leasing and business service enterprises. The increase in TFP of leasing and business service enterprises brought by blockchain innovation is nearly 70 times that of the baseline regression. We further provide blockchain innovation development suggestions for Chinese government based on these conclusions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explain how cryptocurrency is leveraged for illicit purposes across the global financial system. Specifically, it establishes how cryptocurrency has been changing the nature of transnational and domestic money laundering (ML). It then assesses the effectiveness of conventional anti-money laundering (AML) policy and legislation against the proliferation of crypto laundering, using Canada as a critical case study. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from court cases and secondary sources to build cross-case trends of cryptocurrency use in ML. Illicit International Political Economy forms the theoretical foundation for this study, whose contribution is situated in the current literature on crypto-ML. Findings: This study finds that Bitcoin is common among crypto-money launderers, though most also use some form of alt-coin, and that the use of third-party currency exchanges is a prevalent method to create illicit funds and conceal proceeds of crime. The findings validate two hypotheses that illicit use of crypto is prevalent in the first two stages of ML, and that crypto is most often used in conjunction with other fiat currencies. Although law enforcement is improving on monitoring and understanding popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, alt-coins pose a significant challenge for criminal intelligence. New regulations for third-party currency exchanges are having a positive impact on curtailing crypto-laundering but are shown to be insufficient per se to contain the use of crypto in criminal activity. Originality/value: This study contributes to a more robust understanding of the use of virtual currency in transnational and domestic ML. It contributes to an emerging body of literature on the role of technological change in enabling the global flow of illicit funds. It also informs public policy on virtual currency in general, and on AML regulation in Canada in particular. © 2020, Christian Leuprecht, Caitlyn Jenkins and Rhianna Hamilton.},

To do so, we develop a new concept of “exceedance co-kurtosis” which allows us to quantify asymmetry in strong comovement between each cryptocurrency and the inflation expectation rate. The key findings are as follows. First, we show the change in the co-kurtosis asymmetry for major cryptocurrencies: the downside co-kurtosis was higher than the upside co-kurtosis but it decreased after the reopening of the economy. Although the unconditional correlations between cryptocurrencies and the inflation expectation rates remain very low, our results indicate that the major cryptocurrencies become a slightly better inflation hedge after the reopening. Second and more interestingly, the results do not depend on whether a cryptocurrency has a cap on maximum supply or not. Therefore, treating the major cryptocurrencies as digital commodities could be misleading from the viewpoint of portfolio optimization. © 2023},

While blockchain technologies primarily have been associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, they are changing the arts sector, particularly dance and choreography. This transformation has significant implications for understanding the valorization of Black labor and aesthetics. By examining two distinct choreographic initiatives, we can grasp the profound impact of blockchain cultural production and distribution ecosystems. One example is the work of JaQuel Knight, renowned for choreographing iconic music videos, including Beyoncé’s. Knight's efforts to copyright his dances and empower Black choreographers reflect a shift towards artist ownership of dance steps. Another case study involves the Renegade dance, initially popularized on TikTok. Despite its viral success, choreographer Jalaiah Harmon struggled for recognition. Now, with the advent of dance Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), artists can monetize their work and bridge the gap between labor and circulation. These innovative legal and financial pathways mark the emergence of crypto-choreographies, enabling Black artists to reimagine and carry out a post-extractive dance world. This transcends conventional debates of dance appreciation versus appropriation, signaling a transformative shift in aesthetic economies and the limits of choreographic copyright law. © 2023, Juan Manuel Aldape Muñoz.

However, Tor also facilitates cybercriminal actors who utilize it for illicit activities. Quantifying the size and nature of such activity is challenging, as Tor complicates indexing by design. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate both size and nature of illicit commercial activity on the Dark Web. We demonstrate this based on crawling Tor for single-vendor Dark Web Shops, i.e., niche storefronts operated by single cybercriminal actors or small groups. Based on data collected from Tor, we show that just in 2021, Dark Web Shops generated at least 113 million USD in revenue. Sexual abuse is the top illicit revenue category, followed by financial crime at a great distance. We also compare Dark Web Shops' activity with a large Dark Web Marketplace, showing that these are parallel economies. Our methodology contributes towards automated analysis of illicit activity in Tor. Furthermore our analysis sheds light on the evolving Dark Web Shop ecosystem and provides insights into evidence-based policymaking regarding criminal Dark Web activity. © 2013 IEEE.},

An important problem in the implementation of blockchain, in addition to legal regulation, remains the lack of understanding by the majority of managers, civil servants and owners of small, medium and large businesses of the principle of operation of blockchain technologies and their potential advantages for the country’s economy. The experience of blockchain implementation at enterprises of various spheres in EU, which can be useful for Ukraine, was studied. Companies with the largest capitalization that use blockchain platforms are indicated. The advantages of using blockchain in trade have been revealed. Trade is an area where the EU and Ukraine can cooperate in implementing blockchain technology and then use this technology to strengthen economic ties. Due to the fact that the field of innovative technologies is actively developing in the world, more progressive countries can influence the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies by other countries at the state level. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Exploring the safe-haven characteristics of bitcoin from novel perspectives is crucial to diversify the investment and reap the benefits. This investigation employs bootstrap full-and sub-sample techniques to probe time-varying interrelation between global supply chain pressure (GSCP) and bitcoin price (BP), and further answer if “digital gold” could resist the strains of global supply chain. The empirical outcomes suggest that GSCP positively and negatively affects BP. The positive influence points out that high GSCP might boost the international bitcoin market, driving BP to rise, which indicates that “digital gold” could resist the pressures of global supply chain. But the negative effect of GSCP on BP could not support the above view, mainly affected by the weak purchasing power and more valuable assets, which is not consistent with the assumption of the inter-temporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). In turn, GSCP is adversely affected by BP, highlighting that the international bitcoin market may be viewed as a stress reliever for the global supply chain. Against a backdrop of the deteriorative Russia-Ukraine war and the intensifying global supply chain crisis, the above conclusions could bring significative lessons to the public, enterprises and related economies. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the global financial landscape continues to evolve, the emergence of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology has sparked immense interest and debate. This paper examines the impact of Bitcoin on the development of international financial systems, particularly exploring the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The emerging technology of blockchain has the potential to disrupt various industries, affecting businesses in significant ways. In particular, the financial services sector has witnessed the initial applications of blockchain through Bitcoin, leading to advancements in the payments sector. Our study focuses on describing the transformative changes brought about by blockchain technology, which can be categorised into four main ideas. These changes include the introduction of new services that enable peer-to-peer transactions, facilitate cross-border and cross-currency transactions, establish connections between contracts and transactions, and render existing services outdated. By examining these modifications, our research provides valuable insights into how blockchain technology is reshaping the payment landscape and offers guidance for businesses aiming to grow and adapt in this evolving environment. Additionally, our study contributes to the analysis of the effects of this new technology and highlights promising directions for future research in the field of blockchain. Through our investigation, we gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of Bitcoin and blockchain, their impacts on the global economy, and the potential implications for emerging economies once regulations allow for their adoption. Notably, renowned economists have forecasted the continued rise in Bitcoin's value, making it an attractive investment option for potential returns. © 2023 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: "Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Hu.

	abstract = {The present study is a novel attempt to unravel the connectedness of the green bond with energy, crypto, and carbon markets using the S&P green bond index (RSPGB). We consider MAC global solar energy index (RMGS) and ISE global wind energy index (RIGW) as proxies of the energy market and use bitcoin and the European energy exchange carbon index (REEX) for the cryptocurrency and carbon market. Employing the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), Baruník and Krehlík (2018), and wavelet coherence econometric techniques, we find that the energy market (RMGS) has the highest connectedness derived from other asset classes, and bitcoin (RBTC) has the least connectedness. Concurrently, we find that the risk transmission is heterogeneous in different scales as the short period has less connectedness than the medium and long run. We conclude that the overall diversification opportunity among green bonds, energy stock, bitcoin, and the carbon market is more in the short-run than in the medium and long-run. In summary, our findings on the green bond market will provide investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers with critical insight into ensuring a sustainable financial market. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Technological advancement has made a significant contribution to the change of the economy and the advancement of humanity. Because it is changing how economic transactions are carried out, the blockchain is one of the technical developments that has a lot of promise for this progress. The public record of the Bitcoin blockchain provides dispersed users with evidence of transaction ownership by publishing all transaction data from block reward transactions to unspent transaction outputs. Attacks on the public ledger, on the other hand, are a result of the fact that all transaction information are exposed. De-anonymization attacks allow users to link transaction entities and acquire user privacy through specified transaction amounts. As a result, in light of the Bitcoin blockchain system’s privacy issues, this scheme combines the concept of coin mixing with encrypted transaction technology to create a truly anonymous blockchain system that preserves the payer identity and transaction amount privacy. The one-way aggregated signature technique of Boneh, Gentry, and Lynn systematically embeds the notion of mixing into the whole block. The homomorphic encryption approach of Boneh, Goh, and Nissim allows miners to check the legality of encrypted transactions. Miners will validate transactions, conceal transactions, and package transactions as entities in the scheme. Finally, this technique was chosen after a comparison of several privacy-preserving blockchain schemes. It not only ensures complete anonymity, but also keeps transaction storage overhead to a minimum. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of sustainable development and resource productivity has received a lot of attention around the world. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence based financial management and the creation of new blockchains or cryptocurrencies have transformed the day-to-day operations of economic actors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of financial management and blockchains on environmental sustainability and resource productivity. The monthly time series data of the United States of America economy data is used covering the period from 2000M01–2022M09. Firstly, the stationary variable is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The long-term estimations are investigated through the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares. The findings reveal that artificial intelligence-based financial management helps to improve environmental sustainability and resource productivity by reducing carbon emissions and increasing combustible and renewable waste, metals, and non-metallic minerals resources in the long run. In addition, blockchain technology appears to be a booster for environmental unsustainability while also reducing metallic resources. These findings are particularly important and critical since they indicate the path to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, the findings imply that the United States of America authorities should continue to push AI-based sustainability models and move to green blockchains in order to mitigate the negative environmental effects of blockchains. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Data collected from various news aggregators aid in the early indication of the cryptocurrency market movement. The sentiment and public mood states can be uncovered using different techniques such as data mining, natural language processing, and opinion mining. Bitcoin plays the most dominant role in the global economy, and it is extremely important to understand the correlation between news sentiment and price volatility of Bitcoin. This paper assesses news collections and interprets them to forecast the market movement of Bitcoin. Sentiment analysis and deep learning methods, namely long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRUs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs), were used for prediction modeling of Bitcoin prices. Each model was considered on its ability to forecast the Bitcoin early market movement using news sentiment in the Covid-19 era. BiGRU prediction model is developed which achieved an overall accuracy of 70% and showed better performance than the state-of-art cryptocurrency price prediction models based on sentiment analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Supply chains (SC) present performance bottlenecks that contribute to a high level of costs, infiltration of product quality, and impact productivity. Examples of such inhibitors include the bullwhip effect, new product lines, high inventory, and restrictive data flows. These bottlenecks can force manufacturers to source more raw materials and increase production significantly. Also, restrictive data flow in a complex global SC network generally slows down the movement of goods and services. The use of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in SC management (SCM) demonstrates the potentials to reduce these bottlenecks through transparency, decentralization, and optimizations in data management. These technologies promise to enhance the trustworthiness of entities within the SC, ensure the accuracy of data-driven operations, and enable existing SCM processes to migrate from a linear to a fully circular economy. This article presents a comprehensive review of 111 articles published in the public domain in the use and efficacy of DLT in SC. It acts as a roadmap for current and future researchers who focus on SC security management to better understand the integration of digital technologies such as DLT. We clustered these articles using standard descriptors linked to trustworthiness, namely, immutability, transparency, traceability, and integrity.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Using a partial wavelet coherence framework to capture the bivariate co-movement, our findings show strong (weak) positive co-movements among GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) and DJSWI returns, where GBs (sustainable cryptocurrencies) have a heterogeneous leading role in the short-term and long-term horizons. Results indicate moderate positive (negative) co-movement among GBs and sustainable cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and DJSWI in the short run (long run). Overall, the results show GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) acts as a diversifier for Bitcoin and sustainable cryptocurrencies in most cases (DJSWI). However, increasing Bitcoin returns adversely impacts the DJSWI in the long run. Findings are equally imperative for green investors, crypto traders and policymakers, where investors and traders can earn financial and social returns, and policy-makers can deploy suitable policies for the development of sustainable cryptocurrency mining processes. The role of Bitcoin is alarming for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and global greener economy. © 2022 The Author(s).

Our analysis traces the evolution of studies on green bonds’ interactions with other markets, the methodologies and data frequencies used for cross-market relations analysis, and the role of green bonds in portfolio risk management (diversifier, hedge, and safe-haven) in normal and extreme market conditions. The study reports several interesting findings. First, green bonds can be a strategic safe-haven avenue for investors in stocks, dirty energy stocks, and the foreign exchange market in the US and China in extreme market downturns. Second, green bonds demonstrated hedging properties against spillovers from Bitcoin, forex, soft commodities, and CO2 emission allowance. Third, the role of green bonds in the markets of natural gas, industrial metals, and crude oil is limited to a portfolio diversifier in different investment horizons. Fourth, green bonds had no diversification or hedge benefits for investors in conventional bonds. Fifth, the interrelationships between green bonds and most markets’ understudy were influenced by macroeconomic and global factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic policy uncertainty, OVX, and VIX. Our review of the literature also facilitated identification of future research topics. The outcome of the review offers insightful information to investors in green bonds in risk management and assets allocation. Policy makers can benefit from this review in effective policy legislation for the advancement of the green bonds market and acceleration of a smooth transition to a net zero emission economy. © 2023 by the authors.},

We run cointegration and error-correction econometric models for each country, analyzing both the long-term and short-term interactions between Bitcoin volume and time deposits. Our findings indicate a negative association between Bitcoin volume and term deposits in all the MINT countries, except Mexico. This suggests that individual investors in economically and financially unstable nations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as an alternative investment option. The observed effects, while currently modest, highlight the potential threats posed by decentralized cryptocurrencies to the monetary systems of emerging economies, impacting the stability of the banking industry and overall economic growth.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

As a brand-new digital asset, cryptocurrencies are quickly taking over the world economy. Cryptocurrencies are becoming alternative investments as a store of value compared to precious metals. The purpose of this study is to examine the connections between cryptocurrencies, precious metals, and energy resources using structured numerical data. To achieve this goal, two approaches are employed to create networks that reveal relationships between cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink, Litecoin, Stellar, and Ripple), precious metals (Gold, Silver, and Platinum), and energy resources (Oil and Natural Gas) based on their daily prices and returns. The interdependence of the networks is further examined to reveal similarities between the created networks. The proposed methodology facilitates an understanding of the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets, the factors that influence them, and the potential for future research to expand and include additional cryptocurrencies. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2023.},

Blockchain technology is essential for ensuring ownership of bitcoin, a decentralized technology. These coins display high volatility and bubble-like behavior. The widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies poses new challenges to the corporate community and the general public. Currency market traders and fintech researchers have classified cryptocurrencies as speculative bubbles. The study has identified the bitcoin bubble and its breaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2021, we used high-frequency data to calculate the daily closing price of bitcoin. The prophet model and Arima forecasting methods have both been taken. We also examined the explosive bubble and found structural cracks in the bitcoin using the ADF, RADF, and SADF tests. It found five multiple breaks detected from 2018 to 2021 in bitcoin prices. ARIMA(1,1,0) fitted the best model for price prediction. The ARIMA and Facebook Prophet model is applied in the forecasting, and found that the Prophet model is best in forecasting prices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

First, based on high-frequency data, the paper documents that Bitcoin prices did not immediately respond to US monetary policy announcements in the past; they only started doing so in late 2020, in a manner similar to other risky asset prices. Second, based on a structural VAR analysis I study the impact of monetary policy over longer horizons. I confirm the contractionary impact of a US monetary tightening in the post-2020 time period, but show that, historically, a US tightening used to persistently increase rather than decrease Bitcoin prices. To explain this result, I exploit spreads in Bitcoin valuations across currencies and blockchain data and link increased Bitcoin demand to East Asian economies subject to capital controls, particularly China. I discuss implications for the discussion of where demand for Bitcoin stems from: its recent responses to monetary policy confirm its role as a primarily speculative asset; yet, at least historically Bitcoin seems to have derived part if its value from enabling cross-border value transfers and capital flight. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Cryptocurrencies are too confusing for laymen and require more investigation. In this study, we analyze the impact that the effective reproductive rate, an epidemiological indicator of the spread of COVID-19, has on both the price and trading volume of eight of the largest digital currencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, and Binance. We hypothesize that as the rate of spread decreases, the trading price of the digital currency increases. Using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models, we find that the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies varies by currency and region. These findings offer novel insight into the cryptocurrency market and the impact that the viral spread of COVID-19 has on the value of the major cryptocurrencies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

In this work, we first compare the K-Nearest Neighbor model, the Artificial Neural Network model, the grey prediction model, and the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) prediction model for a period of data analysis. The experimental results show that LSTM is superior, and thus LSTM model is selected to forecast the long-term prices in this work. Then, we introduce some indicators, such as convergence divergence ratio and risk coefficient to qualitatively analyze the market price. The five-day moving average method is used to formulate the best trading strategy based on the above-introduced indicators. We apply the commonly used regression indicators (R2 and RMSE) to verify the reliability of the prediction model. Then we introduce new strategies to compare the performance of different ones with them. We found that the five-day moving average method achieved 20% higher returns than the other strategies we used for comparison. Considering the fact that transaction costs may change, we perform the polynomial fitting based on existing strategies by changing the commission cost. The results show that a 1% increase in the gold commission will reduce the total return by 24% to 25%, while a 1% increase in the bitcoin commission will only reduce the total return by 7% to 8%.  © 2022 Aihua Gu et al.},

	abstract = {The ongoing Russian/Ukrainian war, along with sanctions imposed on Russia, poses a major shock to the world economy, merely two years after the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the global economic policy uncertainty has surged due to the resulting spiraling energy prices and economic disruptions. This paper uses a quantile-on-quantile approach to compare the ability of Bitcoin to hedge the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) of major global Bitcoin exchange markets (China, Japan, Korea and the United States) for the periods prior to and post-the COVID-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The results reveal that, prior to the pandemic, significant rises in EPU lead to high Bitcoin returns. After the COVID-19 and the recent war in Ukraine, the hedge effectiveness of Bitcoin is weakening due to the tight correlation with stocks in times of rising inflation expectations and the global central banks' hawkish response to it. Moreover, the Bitcoin hedging property is country-specific, and depends to different Bitcoin market conditions and various uncertainty levels. We explain this heterogeneity by differences across countries in terms of the recognition of Bitcoin as a legal tender, the Bitcoin trading volume, the exchange market maturity, and the investors' attitude towards risk. © (2022), (Economics Bulletin).

	abstract = {Currency is the fundamental economic technology that makes promises credible among actors within and across societies. From shells, to metals, to paper, the technology of money has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of human society. The twenty-first century is witnessing yet another evolution in the technology of money: digital currencies. Although political economy scholarship has begun to focus on digital currencies, this research has largely focused on single early examples like Bitcoin. I argue that this generally narrow focus has obscured important degrees of variation among digital currencies and, by extension, has omitted important lines of research on digital currencies as a familiar evolution in the technology of money. In this article, I revisit the history of digital currencies with explicit attention to not only economic inefficiencies but also political power structures and offer a new typology for theoretically organizing digital currencies along dimensions relevant to practitioners of political economy. I illustrate that variation along these typological dimensions produces important differences among different digital currencies and, relatedly, I explore the implications this has for digital currencies' externalities and governance demands. Drawing on this typology, I conclude with a proposed research agenda for the political economy of digital currencies.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between events reported in international news via categorical discourses and Bitcoin price. Natural language processing was adopted in this study to model data-driven discourses in the crypto-economy, specifically the Bitcoin market. Using topic modelling, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a text analysis of cryptocurrency articles (N = 4218) published from 60 countries in international news media identified key topics associated with cryptocurrency in the international news media from 2018 to 2020. This study provides empirical evidence that across the corpora of international news articles, 18 key topics were framed around the following categorical macro discourses: crypto-related crime, financial governance, and economy and markets. Analysis shows that the identified discourses may have had a social signal' effect on movements in the crypto-financial markets, particularly on Bitcoin's price volatility. Results show these specific discourses proved to have a negative effect on Bitcoin's market price, within 24 h of when the crypto news articles were published. Further, the study found that in some cases, the source of the news may have amplified the volatility effect, particularly in terms of geographical region, relative to broader market conditions. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

	abstract = {The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic created a shock not only for the health-care industry but also the global economy and finances. The pandemic also caused an increase in the risk of investing in various financial assets worldwide. To investigate this phenomenon empirically, this study analyzes the behavior of financial assets through risk and return in the time of the Covid-19 outbreak, using the GARCH (Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) family methods. This study conducts a group analysis asset price performance, based on stock markets in Muslim-majority countries and the Group of Seven (G7) and alternative financial assets. This asset group is selected to represent the characteristics of the global financial market with possibly varied behavior. The results of the study show, first, that the severity of the pandemic had a negative effect on the price performance of some assets, such as Indonesia (Jakarta Islamic Index), the UK (United Kingdom100 Index, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), commodities, 10-year US bonds, and Bitcoin, but the price performance of other assets went in the opposite direction, for example, Malaysia (FBMHS Index), the US (S&P 500 Index), and gold. Second, during the pandemic, most assets became more risky. Third, prices on G7 and Islamic stocks and alternative asset groups had different price and risk convergence patterns. The pandemic contributed to price differentials but not much changed in the risk patterns of the assets. Stock prices in the markets of Muslim-majority countries moved randomly—that is, they did not tend to converge in the pre-crisis period. However, before and during the pandemic, asset risk converged in the markets of Muslim-majority countries, which means that the risk of investing in assets there has long-term risk following the same pattern (i.e., if it increases in one country, assets in the other countries will follow). This pattern makes it easier for investors to observe and make risk decisions on investment in Islamic assets in Muslim-majority countries, so this investment in these assets is sustainable. This study suggests that investment managers diversify financial portfolios based on the type of assets and the severity of the pandemic and the policy response in the relevant country. © 2022 Borsa Ä°stanbul Anonim Åžirketi},

ICOs were supposed to be a new, radically disruptive way of crowdfunding to finance the development of a new, radically disruptive blockchain technological ecosystem. All told, ICOs raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 alone. But by all analyses—both from observers and participants, both during the bubble and after—the vast majority of ICO turned out to be scams. This article uses these scams to theorize the “network scam” as a collaborative effort to bring about a shared future, but one that is fundamentally characterized by arbitrage on uneven belief among participants in that future ever coming to pass. © The Author(s) 2022.},

First, it models and forecasts the risk of the five leading cryptocurrencies, stock market indices (developed and BRICS) and gold returns. Second, it conducts different backtesting procedures forecasts. Third, it focuses on the hedging potential of cryptocurrencies and gold. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) models to model and forecast the risk of cryptocurrencies, stock market indices and gold returns. They conduct different backtesting procedures of the 1% and 5%-value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts. They also use the generalized orthogonal generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GO-GARCH) model to explore the hedging potential of cryptocurrencies by estimating the dynamic conditional correlation between cryptocurrencies and gold, on the one hand, and stock markets on the other hand. Findings: When conducting different backtesting procedures of VaR, our finding suggests that Bitcoin has the highest VaR among cryptocurrencies and Gold and the BRICS indices returns have lower VaR compared to the developed countries. Finally, we provide evidence that the risks among developed stock markets can be hedged by Bitcoin and Gold. Bitcoin can be considered as the new Gold for these economies. Unlike Bitcoin, Gold can be considered as a hedge for Chinese and Indian investors. However, Gold and Bitcoin can be considered as diversifier assets for the other BRICS economies while Dash and Monero are diversifier assets for developed stock markets. Originality/value: The first paper's empirical contribution lies in analyzing optimal forecast models for cryptocurrencies (other than Bitcoin) returns and risk. The second contribution consists of studying the hedging potential of five leading cryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of cryptocurrencies for BRICS investors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This new market aims to reinvent traditional financial products in a more transparent and interoperable way. In this paper we aim to undertake an extensive literature review of the financial stability risks posed by the fast-growing DeFi market and assess these using the Financial Stability Board’s fintech framework.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the price return of leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Stellar, Peercoin and Dash, and stock return of technology companies' indices that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services, including alternative finance, democratized banking, future payments and digital communities. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a Bayesian asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (BADCC-MGARCH) model with skewness and heavy tails on daily sample ranging from August 11, 2015, to February 10, 2020, to investigate the dynamic correlation between price return of several cryptocurrencies and stock return of the technology companies' indices that mainly operate on the blockchain platform. Data are collected from multiple sources. For parameter estimation and model comparison, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is employed. Besides, based on the expected Akaike information criterion (EAIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance information criterion (DIC) and weighted Deviance Information Criterion (wDIC), the skewed-multivariate Generalized Error Distribution (mvGED) is selected as an optimal distribution for errors. Finally, some other tests are carried out to check the robustness of the results. Findings: The study results indicate that blockchain-based technology companies' indices' return and price return of cryptocurrencies are positively correlated for most of the sampling period. Besides, the return price of newly invented and more advanced cryptocurrencies with unique characteristics, including Monero, Ripple, Dash, Stellar and Peercoin, positively correlates with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more than 93% of sampling days. The results are also robust to various sensitivity analyses. Research limitations/implications: The positive correlation between the price return of cryptocurrencies and the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies can be due to the investors' sentiments toward blockchain technology as both cryptocurrencies and these companies are based on blockchain technology. It could also be due to the applicability of cryptocurrencies for these companies, as the price return of more advanced and capable cryptocurrencies with unique features has a positive correlation with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more days compared to the other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, that may be regarded more as speculative assets. Practical implications: The study results may show the positive role of cryptocurrencies in improving and developing technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services and vice versa, suggesting that managers and regulators should pay more attention to the usefulness of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. This study also has important risk management and diversification implications for investors and companies investing in cryptocurrencies and these companies' stock. Besides, blockchain-based technology companies can add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio as hedgers or diversifiers based on their strategy. Originality/value: This is the first study analyzing the connection between leading cryptocurrencies and technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services by employing the Bayesian ssymmetric DCC-MGARCH model. The results also have important implications for investors, companies, regulators and researchers for future studies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {FinTech has proven its true potential in traditional financial offerings by delivering digital financial services to individuals worldwide. The pandemic has accelerated how people interact with financial services and has resulted in long-term changes to societies and economies. FinTech has expanded access to financial services and has made such changes possible. FinTech or Financial Technology refers to using new technologies for financial services. Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and cloud computing are a few technologies currently being applied to FinTech. In this paper, we consider FinTech, which partly uses blockchain technology. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in the financial sector as it ultimately lifts trust and the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. This survey provides a comprehensive summary of the most relevant blockchain-based FinTech implementations and an overview of FinTech sectors and segments. For each segment, we provide a critique and a discussion on how each blockchain implementation contributes to solving the majority of problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. This research aims to direct the future of financial solutions by providing an outline of the applications of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology (DLT) for FinTech. We discuss various implementations, limitations, and challenges of blockchain-based FinTech applications. We conclude this work by exploring possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and future research directions. © 2022 by the authors.},

This is to ensure, among other things, market rate behavior, market economics, the implementation and regulation of tax laws, and consumer safety inside the distinctive attributes of the investments, all while encouraging the development of a profitable bitcoin economy. Vietnam is no different, especially as cryptocurrencies are known to be cross-jurisdictional, and as such, supervisory difficulties do not end at state boundaries. Recent developments in Vietnam indicate that they are moving toward cross-jurisdictional regulatory norms to promote regulatory clarity, remove loopholes, and prevent regulatory arbitrage, all while adhering to stringent currency control. There also has been some recent recognition of crypto-based inventions and efficiency in money and trade, notably for cross-border dealings. Some progressive examples in this paper are illustrated to develop dispute resolution mechanisms for e-commerce using new technology.

	abstract = {As the number of people infected with COVID-19 continues to rise, a number of nations have implemented state wide quarantines. This has resulted in a global financial crisis that is having severe impacts on countries all around the world. As a direct consequence of the epidemic, unemployment rates have increased in a number of different regions, which has a substantial and detrimental effect on trade across the globe. In light of the current state of the economy, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is causing a shift in the manner in which businesses evaluate their bitcoin holdings. The application of AI in a commercial setting has the potential to produce a wide range of beneficial results. We are spared from completing as much manual labour as a direct result of the favourable effects that AI has had on technology. These consequences can be noticed in our day-to-day lives. In the event that there is a pandemic, having knowledge of AI and the various strategies it employs, such as the classifier model, could be beneficial. Humans will be better suited to make decisions if they have rapid access to the analyses and projections that are created by AI and big data. In order to be prepared for the arrival of the new world, the company is putting in more effort, in collaboration with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups, to improve the administration of virtual enterprises by having a presence on a variety of different e-trade systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilised in a variety of settings to assist with the process of identifying and implementing workable solutions to a variety of problems that can develop in the workplace. AI is being used to improve business operations in a wide variety of spheres, including marketing, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer assistance, portfolio management, and product recommendations based on customer preferences. These are just few of the sectors. These are just a few examples of the kinds of problems that artificial intelligence might be able to solve in the future. Given the present worth of cryptocurrencies, technological developments may also be made in order to improve the performance of the rules that have been provided and produce the most accurate conclusion that is possible.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of information technology and industrial revolutions provoked digital transformation of all sectors, from the government to households. Moreover, digital transformations led to the development of cryptocurrency. However, crypto trading provokes a dilemma loop. On the one hand, crypto trading led to economic development, which allowed attracting additional resources to extending smart and green technologies for de-carbonising the economic growth. On the other hand, crypto trading led to intensifying energy sources, which provoked an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. The paper aims to analyse the connec-tions between crypto trading, economic development of the country, renewable energy consump-tion, and environmental degradation. The data for analysis were obtained from: Our World in Data, World Data Bank, Eurostat, Ukrstat, Crystal Blockchain, and KOF Globalisation Index. To check the hypothesis, the paper applied the Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests, FMOLS and DOLS panel cointegration models, and Vector Error Correction Models. The findings concluded that the increasing crypto trading led to enhanced GDP, real gross fixed capital formation, and globalisation. However, in the long run, the relationship between crypto trading and the share of renewable energies in total energy consumption was not confirmed by the empirical results. For further direc-tions, it is necessary to analyse the impact of crypto trading on land and water pollution. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This paper analyzes the price trends of gold and bitcoin, which builds a price prediction model and a trading model. First, to achieve a higher yield, we need to make a forecast for gold and bitcoin and then design a trading strategy based on the forecast. In this paper, we use two models to make forecasts. Using ARIMA Time Series Analysis, we need to predict past price movements with 1826 cycles. We need to find the characteristics of current and past price movements that have an impact on future price movements. In this paper, we use Boruta Random Forest Algorithm to filter out the four factors that have the most influence on the price of gold and bitcoin, respectively, from a total of 21 variables, and finally, we use the price trend prediction values and get an investment strategy. Traders can get $92,115.43 on 9/10/2021 for $1,000 on 9/11/2016 with the strategy. The five-year return reached 9111.54%, with an average annualized return of 147.10%. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There has been a burgeoning Fintech literature in the past years, especially on cryptocurrencies. However, there is lack of research handling cryptocurrencies in a mainstream macroeconomic model. To bridge the gap, we develop a model for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency as risky and costly bubbles in an infinite-horizon production economy. This model is consistent with the following facts: (1) the surging Bitcoin market presents enormous volatility, (2) its price dynamics are significantly sensitive to both market sentiment and policy stances. Entrepreneurial firms choose to hold Bitcoins as liquid assets to buffer idiosyncratic investment distortions. The intrinsically worthless Bitcoins can emerge as rational bubbles when the market sentiment is optimistic enough. On the one hand, bubbly Bitcoins provide market liquidity to facilitate investment in the real sector, while on the other hand, they deteriorate the investment efficiency and crowd out aggregate production. Our quantitative exercise produces various cyclical features of Bitcoin bubbles and find that the collapse of Bitcoin bubbles can improve social welfare by decreasing distortion-driven real investment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is a revolution started as a new economy with an alternative currency namely Bitcoin. Besides the economical aspect, the technological capabilities of Blockchain such as distributed computing, record keeping, irrecoverability of transactions, reliability and etc., are harnessed by variety of real-world applications. Blockchain is a rising pool of records known as blocks linked using security procedure. It is typically managed by a group of nodes in a distributed network technology which integrates technologies such as distributed ledger, security and consensus algorithm to ensure reliability and immutability. In Blockchain, the access privileges are determined by a set of nodes called miners, which run the consensus algorithm to access and submit transactions in to the block after authentication. However, in the existing Blockchain, there is no mechanism to ensure the trust and robustness of the miners and eliminate the malicious miners which runs the consensus algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a trust model with an objective of eliminating untrusted nodes from the mining process to enhance the reliability and security of the Blockchain. Further, the proposed trust model is suitably analysed for transaction rate, efficiency and scalability with Hyper Ledger framework to ensure the robustness. © 2022 R.

	abstract = {Scientific sources demonstrate different attitudes of researchers to cryptocurrencies because they treat them as a category of currency, virtual money, commodity, etc. Accordingly, the relation to the valuation and risk of cryptocurrency as an investment object is different. The purpose of the article is to identify cryptocurrency value formation factors and determine the risks of investing in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is simultaneously considered a currency, an asset with uncertain income, and a specific product, the price of which is determined by the energy costs for mining new cryptocurrency blocks. Thus, the paper examines the risks of investing in cryptocurrency from several positions. First, the study identifies the factors of formation of the value and risk of cryptocurrency as ordinary money based on comparing cryptocurrency with traditional money. Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrency is not tied to the economic performance of a particular country; also, central banks do not control or regulate their mining. Instead, the cryptocurrency emissions depend on the computational capacity of the equipment used for their mining. As a financial asset, cryptocurrency can be a “financial bubble” because their value increasing often exceeds the cost of mining. On the other hand, given the emergence of cryptocurrency as a phenomenon of the information economy, the paper analyses the impact of specific technical features (cryptographic hashing algorithm, the complexity of creating new blocks, the technology of verification of mining operations, etc.) on the risk of investing in cryptocurrency assets. © 2022 University of Tehran.

The paper examines datacenter management and sustainability practices in the Nordic region. It explores what community impacts occur, and how communities manage conflicting objectives. It investigates the technical and policy options that can make datacenters more sustainable and/or lower-carbon and it explores associated stakeholder and public views in the three countries. In exploring these themes, our study examines the shifting energy governance of datacenters, including patterns of electricity consumption and cooling but also circular economy operations and power densities. We also analyze a series of 40 solutions for eco-friendly design or green datacenter management across the entire lifecycle. We conclude with implications for energy and climate policy as well as future research. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The price of Bitcoin is once more soaring. From early October 2020 to early January 2021, the price of a single Bitcoin token went from roughly $10,000 to nearly $65,000, reinspiring the hopes of the crypto-faithful in the inevitability of a future beyond centralized banking and leaving the rest to dread the jargon of computational libertarianism. The speculative betting driving this recent price action, however, belies a more rudimentary and overlooked shift in the digital economy signaled by cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular. Unlike an earlier industrial logic that sought to reduce heat loss and improve efficiency to maximize surplus value, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system shifts the basis of value production from efficiency to inefficiency. Moreover, it does so by using a cryptographic algorithm whose purpose is to destroy the meaning of its inputs. Through an exploration of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work technics and its inversion of traditional models of value extraction, the text argues that Bitcoin reveals a profound transformation in the nature of surplus represented by computational capitalism. © 2022 The University of Chicago.

	abstract = {In the modern financial system, the ability to create money is in the hands of a few central institutions. Blockchain networks, and by extension cryptocurrencies, were created with the promise of giving that power to users. The most well-known example of a blockchain technology achieving such decentralization is Bitcoin, but its popularity has arguably been matched by an alternative-currency named Dogecoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which have marketed themselves on differentiating technical features, Dogecoin’s allure likely stems from its cultural roots as a meme. Where cryptocurrency is typically regarded as a difficult topic to grasp, the introduction of Doge’s (2013) most popular meme, into the crypto-space increased crypto’s accessibility to new participants. Consequently, Dogecoin exists in two economies: the financial economy and the cultural meme economy, with the latter having unprecedented tangible impacts on the former. Dogecoin’s unique cultural significance provides an example of how blockchain can succeed in promoting alternative money systems. At its peak in 2021, Dogecoin achieved a market capitalization of $88 billion. Where analysis of the Dogecoin phenomenon is lacking in the current literature, we will fill that gap with a case study of Dogecoin. By studying Dogecoin as a combination of money and meme, we can further our understanding of how to better promote social finance initiatives through the virality of memes. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Indeed, this paper is the first study to ascertain whether green commodities, Bitcoins, and uncertainty are connected to the US stock market. Using the quantile vector autoregressive (VAR) connectedness framework, the key findings are as follows: (i) A static spillover network showed there was high spillover transfer between markets at extreme market states. (ii) Global green economy and global clean energy markets act as the highest contributors of information spillover under bearish market scenarios. (iii) With regard to dynamic connectedness, this work highlights the asymmetric spillover effect of green commodities, Bitcoins, and uncertainty on the US stock market. (iv) Bitcoin (BTC), uncertainty, and global carbon indexes were found to be net receipts of shock spillovers, while most green commodities acted as net contributors.

The combination of a public health emergency, economic distress, and misinformation-driven panic have pushed customers and vendors towards the shadow economy. In particular, dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial websites accessible via free software, have gained significant popularity. Here, we analyse 851,199 listings extracted from 30 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020. We identify 788 listings directly related to COVID-19 products and monitor the temporal evolution of product categories including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medicines (e.g., hydroxyclorochine), and medical frauds. Finally, we compare trends in their temporal evolution with variations in public attention, as measured by Twitter posts and Wikipedia page visits. We reveal how the online shadow economy has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of a continuous monitoring of DWMs, especially now that real vaccines are available and in short supply. We anticipate our analysis will be of interest both to researchers and public agencies focused on the protection of public health. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Since cryptocurrency is generated and consumed by Blockchain systems, Blockchain-specific information can be considered as the main component in forecasting the values of cryptocurrency.

However, we find that Ethereum, a popular and leading cryptocurrency in the market, has Blockchain information that differs from that of Bitcoin. Hence, this study investigates the relationship between inherent Ethereum Blockchain information and Ethereum prices. Furthermore, we investigate how Blockchain information concerning other publicly available coins on the market is associated with Ethereum prices.

Different ways of investing provide different guarantees of income, but in all cases there is a risk that instead of profit, the investor will receive a loss. Therefore, the development of investment software that allows you to analyze and evaluate the growth or fall in the value of digital assets is an urgent issue. The computer system under consideration is designed to monitor and analyze the cryptocurrency exchange rate in real time. The purpose of the work is to describe the functional purpose and structural elements of the system for tracking changes in the cryptocurrency exchange rate to make a decision on its purchase/sale. The information system is written in the PyCharm integrated development environment in Python. The article presents the development technology of the system under consideration and shows a practical example of its work on the process of monitoring the bitcoin cryptocurrency. In the future, this system can be improved with additional functionality and a more flexible interface #CSOC1120. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Recently, cryptocurrency technology as an innovative technology has attracted attention and spread. Cryptocurrencies known as virtual currencies that have been widely used to buy and sell products and services over the internet, as well as a popular asset for hedging and speculation. However, current study and statistic shows that customers have high level of awareness but low acceptance towards cryptocurrency. In addition, the number of studies on cryptocurrency adoption in Malaysia also very less. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examines the accepting financial transaction using cryptocurrency from a customer perspective. The outcome of this study shows that (i) security and perceived ease of use are having a significant relationship with behavioral intention towards acceptance of cryptocurrency transactions; (ii) perceived trust and social influence are having no significant relationship with behavioral intention towards acceptance of cryptocurrency transactions. This study is important because it will help investors and potential customers to increase their knowledge in using and adopt cryptocurrency in their transaction.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Leveraging watchtowers to monitor payment channel networks (PCNs) is regarded to be a promising option to ensure off-chain transaction security and boost cryptocurrency scalability. However, existing solutions have two major limitations: First, since the watchtower's inaction or collusion with counterparties, the deposits in off-chain transactions will be threatened; Second, due to occasional false positives, the efficiency of the single watchtower in monitoring the payment channels for fraud is questionable. To solve this, we present anti-collusion multiparty smart contracts for distributed watchtowers in PCNs. Specifically, we first design the distributed watchtower mechanism to solve the false positive problem in regulating PCNs. In addition, we utilize smart contracts to constrain and force counterparties to relinquish collusion in the distributed watchtower mechanism, thus making collusion impossible for rational parties. We further offer a mathematical proof and contract implementation in Solidity. Finally, extensive experiments and contracts executed on Ethereum under various benchmarks with baseline comparison demonstrate the validity of our proposals. Specifically, our scheme can both improve the throughput and accuracy by up to 20-25% and 10-15%, respectively, and reduce the false positive rate by up to 10% compared with existing single watchtower mechanism.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

Methodology: the text constitutes a qualitative analysis of doctrine and legislation, with results obtained by the inductive method. Results: the anonymity provided by the systems used by cryptocurrencies can encourage the practice of crimes such as money laundering, tax evasion, drug trade, illegal sale of arms and others, which has led some countries to issue regulations on the use of cryptocurrencies. The problem with regulation lies in the fact that it is technically very complex to identify both ownership and operations carried out through this type of asset, and there are even those who claim that such a possibility does not exist, at least with the means and technology currently available. Contributions: in addition to the historical-evolutionary approach of the central theme, the text addresses issues such as the concept of currency; the economic relations in the informational era, with the increasing transactions of virtual currencies in electronic networks; the legal security; monitoring and regulation by a monetary authority to curb the financing of illegal activities, money laundering or possible financial instability in the economy and the technical limits that challenge the effectiveness of this type of regulation.

Although the previous empirical evidence points towards strong connections among selected cryptocurrencies or, from the other side, weak dependence between Bitcoin and traditional financial assets, a focused study on the dynamics of return and volatility connectedness among a wider range of cryptocurrencies is lacking, and more so, one directed towards the very first actual critical period of the global economy coinciding with relevant crypto-markets. Using data for the 10 most capitalized cryptocurrencies between 1st October 2017 and 5th January 2021, we examine how cryptocurrencies interact and whether they have a clear leader, with a special focus on differences with respect to investment horizons and how the relationship structure evolves in time. We uncover a structural change in the connectedness evolving in 2020 as the market restructures in reaction to the unprecedented monetary injections as a counter to the COVID-19-induced economic standstill. The structural change is shown not only for cryptocurrencies considered separately but also when we jointly examine them with traditional assets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Its links and interactions with all of the country's relevant enterprises enable it to benefit from every part of the country. When gauging the social and economic well-being of a country, an agricultural base must be substantial. Agriculture is by far the main source of employment in most countries. It has many components, including supply chain management, crop insurance, and shipping of goods, which requires numerous unverified parties, such as farmers, retailers, customers, and wholesalers (assessor, surveyors). A case could be made that due to the presence of a middle man (i.e. human beings or human-operated agencies) crucial issues such as accessibility, expediency, security, and immutability have been raised. As a result, financial loss, crop contamination, and waste have occurred. Blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, is a decentralized shareholding ledger that collects data from multiple parties involved in the Bitcoin network transactions. For this reason, the Bitcoin network relies on the Blockchain to keep track of transaction history and other transaction-related information, such as the transaction's completion, the addresses of the sender(s) and the recipient(s), and information about whether the transaction was successful. Donors can be confident that the money will be given to only one organization. To keep information private, every piece of data is encrypted on the Blockchain.

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper provides new evidence for Bitcoin’s safe-haven property by examining the relationship between currency price, return and Bitcoin trading volume. Design/methodology/approach: A unique dataset from a person-to-person (p2p) exchange is used to investigate association between Bitcoin trading volume and currency prices. Currency returns are used to identify local economic crises, the 8 crisis affected currencies are Venezuela Bolivar (VES), Iranian Rial (IRR), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Argentine Peso (ARS), Egyptian Pound (EGP), Nigerian Naira (NGN), Turkish Lira (TRY) and Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT). Findings: The paper demonstrates that local economic crises are positively associated with increased Bitcoin trading. There is a negative association between trading volume and currency value (and return), suggesting low currency price and currency depreciation are accompanied with increased Bitcoin trading. The results not only hold for the crisis affected currencies but also currencies of advanced economies. Granger causality test also reinforces the negative association results. Originality/value: The finding indicates some forms of flight-to-safety have occurred during local market crises when capital flight from domestic markets to Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin’s hedging asset status. However, total global trading volume declines after the start of the COVID pandemic, suggesting that Bitcoin is still regarded as a speculative asset. Overall, the findings show that Bitcoin is a hedging asset to protect against local currency depreciation, but not a safe-haven asset for the global crisis. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This article finds that in an open, free market economy, with a privately accessible state mint and an official currency based on a metallic standard, supply or demand shocks leave prices stable both in the short run and in the long run, with the exception of when the currency is debased. The stabilization property of this kind of currency derives from the mechanism by which changes in commodity prices motivate the holders of the stock of currency to shift their demand for it such that its acquisition cost equates to its purchasing power in terms of goods and services. When a country is large relative to the international market for specie, maintenance of price stability may require adjustments in the seigniorage charge, whereas in countries with closed economies such adjustments are in general imperative. In addition, through seigniorage adjustments, the price level may even be held fixed irrespective of the magnitude and origin of shocks, the relative size of the country, and the degree of its openness, whereas at the zero bound of the seigniorage charge, the same result may be achieved though lowering the specie content of the currency. These results are consistent with the monetary experiences of Athens in classical times, France during the period AD 1350–1436, Spain in the sixteenth century, the United States in AD 1870–1914, and China in AD 1910–35. Additionally, since electronic money such as bitcoin has properties similar to gold or silver, these results may extend to a cryptocurrency standard. © 2022, Ludwig Von Mises Institute.

This technology relies on a backbone of distributed data architecture and peer-to-peer networking model called Blockchain. Unlike the current digital economy, which is governed centrally by financial institution or governments, Blockchain is fully autonomous without any third-party involvement. The exorbitant success of Bitcoin has attracted investors, scholars as well as organizations to peek into this lucrative technology for the possible application to other areas apart from crypto-currency. Blockchain can adopt Smart Contracts, which are digitally enabled contracts that can be executed and enforced fully or partially using pre-defined notions. The aim of this research is to investigate the synergy between Smart Contract and Blockchain to propose a digital framework for an academic paper publication model that has the capability to automate the entire process and challenge the existing system. It can also bring together all the stakeholders under the same system. The proposed model can further hold the stakeholders accountable for breach of contracts and/or reward them for executing the successes of terms pre-configured in the Smart Contract. The proposed model, called Digital Smart Publication or DSP (as referred in the document), is highly secure and ensures balance in distributing rewards to the involved stakeholders while keeping data integrity and security as paramount features. © 2019, Amol Thakre, Fadi Thabtah, Seyed Reza Shahamiri and Suhel Hammoud.},

Miners are responsible for validating transactions and are incentivized to participate by the promise of a monetary reward. Mining pools have emerged as collectives of miners that ensure a more stable and predictable income. MiningVis aims to help analysts understand the evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including mining market statistics, multi-measure mining pool rankings, and pool hopping behavior. Each of these features can be compared to external data concerning pool characteristics and Bitcoin news. In order to assess the value of MiningVis, we conducted online interviews and insight-based user studies with Bitcoin miners.

	abstract = {Currently, the most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin. Predicting the future value of bitcoin can help investors to make more educated decisions and to provide authorities with a point of reference for evaluating cryptocurrency. The novelty of the proposed prediction models lies in the use of artificial intelligence to identify movement cryptocurrency prices, particularly bitcoin prices. A forecasting model that can accurately and reliably predict the market’s volatility and price variations is necessary for portfolio management and optimization in this continually expanding financial market. In this paper, we investigate a time series analysis that makes use of deep learning to investigate volatility and provide an explanation for this behavior. Our findings have managerial ramifications, such as the potential for developing a product for investors. This can help to expand upon our model by adjusting various hyperparameters to produce a more accurate model for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies. Another possible managerial implication of our findings is the potential for developing a product for investors, as it can predict the price of cryptocurrencies more accurately. The proposed models were evaluated by collecting historical bitcoin prices from 1 January 2021 to 16 June 2022. The results analysis of the GRU and MLP models revealed that the MLP model achieved highly efficient regression, at R = 99.15% during the training phase and R = 98.90% during the testing phase. These findings have the potential to significantly influence the appropriateness of asset pricing, considering the uncertainties caused by digital currencies. In addition, these findings provide instruments that contribute to establishing stability in cryptocurrency markets. By assisting asset assessments of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, our models deliver high and steady success outcomes over a future prediction horizon. In general, the models described in this article offer approximately accurate estimations of the real value of the bitcoin market. Because the models enable users to assess the timing of bitcoin sales and purchases more accurately, they have the potential to influence the economy significantly when put to use by investors and traders. © 2022 by the authors.},

This paper looks at Bitcoins as a separate asset class and attempts to capture the volatility using the Exponential GARCH (E-GARCH) as well as to check if Bitcoins can be used as an optimal tool to hedge using the Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH against four traditional asset classes in the U.S. economy which includes the stock market (S&P 500 index), Bonds (U.S. Aggregate Bond Index), Gold and Crude Oil. The period of study is a little over 7 years. The results suggest that Bitcoin stands as a highly speculative class of asset with extremely high volatility and with respect to hedging, Bitcoin stands as a possible tool of hedge with the U.S. Aggregate Bond index and to a certain extent against Gold but fails to be an optimal hedge against the S&P 500 and Crude Oil in the U.S. economy between April 29, 2013 and October 31, 2019 due to its highly volatile nature. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin prediction is a recent area of research interest and growing fast. Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The epidemic of COVID-19 has struck devastation on the economy. The recent decline in the bitcoin market should be regarded as a blip on the radar. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that should be considered an asset class with a long-term growth forecast. In 2020, the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has become a precious asset. When we look at Bitcoin’s previous pricing, we can see that it has increased by more than 500% in just 6 months. In this scenario, providing recent estimates for the closing price of Bitcoin shortly using the Box-Jenkins model for the period 2021–2022 becomes even more relevant. As a consequence of the five-step iterative approach, the empirical data indicated that the price of bitcoin is projected to rise shortly in both static and dynamic forecasts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Money has started to be perceived as a consumable service with multiple providers from which to choose. In such an environment, the question of how people consume money—instead of how they consume with money—grows in importance. This article is based on ethnographic research of Bitcoin communities in Prague and Bratislava. It examines how users variously consume Bitcoin and what consequences these diverse ways of consumption can have for the Bitcoin economy. The article identifies two discrete spheres of consumption that closely correlate with “transactional orders” or spheres of exchange as described in classical works of economic anthropology, for example, by Parry and Bloch. One of the spheres is concerned with the reproduction of social order, while the other considers the personal gain of individual consumers. The article also examines the tension between these two spheres and how it is dialectically resolved through strategies of conversion. In the final discussion, the case of Bitcoin is compared with other anthropological accounts of spheres of exchange, with special attention oriented to their dissimilarities. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association.},

We show that both the production of and the speculation with Bitcoin draw from the existing global pool of value-added. By extending the Classical Political Economy approach and the New Interpretation of the labour theory of value to the domain of digital commodities, the paper argues that Bitcoin mining is an automated reproduction process that requires no direct (living) labour and thus creates no new value. Bitcoin, in this regard, is not ‘digital gold’. Between sectors, Bitcoin mining redistributes wealth and value-added already in existence, while Bitcoin miners with more computational power compete to appropriate the mining profits within the blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain then creates rivalry in both the ownership and the use of the digital commodity through non-legal means. Our approach can be further expanded to the larger domain of automated digital commodities that are reproducible without the expenditure of direct, living labour. © 2022 The Author(s).

The main objective that we set ourselves is to delve into the knowledge of cryptocurrencies and the technology that supports them, in a way that allows us to have a clear idea of the consequences that their appearance has not only in the financial field, but also in the economy in general. If we make an approximation to these cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we will be able to be aware of the advantages of their use, as well as the disadvantages of their existence, which will allow us to be aware of the role that this technology can play in the present, in the short term and long term, especially in the business field. After this analysis of the origins of Bitcoin and its evolution, we study its correlation with several assets and indices: Ethereum (second cryptocurrency with the highest value), gold (commodity considered as a refuge value), S&P500 (the most representative index of the US market) and the MSCI World Index (most representative global index), briefly explaining each of these assets, to finally analyze their correlation with Bitcoin from the year for which we have data for each one. © 2022, Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods, including a one-way analysis of variance, a paired t-test, a simple regression analysis, and an in-depth interview, were employed. One of the conclusions implies that tourists in a tourism destination still prefer paying with cash rather than paying with card or virtual currency. Moreover, the study discovered that tourists count more on virtual currency and prepare for a future with virtual currency when a factor that has an unstable impact on social economy, such as COVID-19, happens. As to the functions of Bitcoin, tourists appeared to place a great importance on its storage, value, satisfaction, convenience, and investment. Additionally, the study showed that tourists intend to continue using Bitcoin due to the same satisfaction, convenience, and investment attributed to Bitcoin.

The vast majority of miners today participate in "mining pools"instead of "solo mining"in order to lower risk and achieve a more steady income. However, this rise of participation in mining pools negatively affects the decentralization levels of most cryptocurrencies. In this work, we look into mining pools from the point of view of a miner: We present an analytical model and implement a computational tool that allows miners to optimally distribute their computational power over multiple pools and PoW cryptocurrencies (i.e. build a mining portfolio), taking into account their risk aversion levels. Our tool allows miners to maximize their risk-adjusted earnings by diversifying across multiple mining pools. Our underlying techniques are drawn from both the areas of financial economy and computer science since we use computer science-based approaches (i.e. optimization techniques) to experimentally prove how parties (and in particular miners) interact with cryptocurrencies in a way of increasing their Sharpe ratio. To showcase our model, we run an experiment in Bitcoin historical data and demonstrate that a miner diversifying over multiple pools, as instructed by our model/tool, receives a higher overall Sharpe ratio (i.e. average excess reward over its standard deviation/volatility). © 2022 The Author(s).},

We report that blockchain technology research in finance has evolved and is predominated by studies on crowdfunding/equity crowdfunding, entrepreneurial finance, bitcoin, entrepreneurship, fintech, and venture capital. However, several of these studies are contextually based, with scantily used cases leading to the design of frameworks and architectures. Additionally, the majority of the studies could not afford sufficient details on the practical discharge of the few blockchain-enabled prototypes. © 2022},

	abstract = {A monetary model is established to introduce that bitcoin does have the characteristics of a price rise when the economic situation is terrible under high risk aversion. At this time, Bitcoin has the property of a safe-haven asset, and when economic conditions are good and risk aversion is low, Bitcoin has a pro-cyclical nature. At this time, Bitcoin has a stronger property as a medium of exchange. To show the movement law of the bitcoin price, we make a logarithmic linearization of the model and simulation, and the result is consistent with the theoretical analysis. To better understand the role of bitcoin in the real economy, several standard portfolio models are used to measure the similarities and differences between gold and bitcoin in an investment portfolio. After the outbreak of COVID-19, bitcoin has shown stronger safe-haven asset properties. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Following the success of digital coins, such as Bitcoin, blockchain technology, on which digital coins are based, has attracted much attention. One of the main capabilities of blockchain is “to ensure any saved data is exactly the same as when it was generated” and that such data cannot be tampered with or destroyed. Therefore, the information written on blockchain is undeniable and absolutely credible. The cover story of the Economist in its October 2015 issue calls blockchain the “trust machine”. Related theories about the core capabilities of blockchain, i.e., “increases in information symmetry “ and “increases in mutual trust”, are used to construct the basis of an economic theory of blockchain to explore the potential application of blockchain and to consider incentives for the application of blockchain in marine debris removal in this research. Plastic debris leaks into the ocean and cause an unprecedented ecological catastrophe. This has become a hot topic for discussion amongst all disciplines. In an article published in 2016 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which is committed to promoting the global circular economy, it stated that, at present, as much as 8 million metric tons of plastic debris leaked into the ocean each year, and if this continued, there would be more plastic than fish in the ocean around the globe by 2050. Following this shocking prediction, it was firmly declared in the G20 Osaka Summit, consisting of representatives from 20 nations, to reduce the environmental impacts caused by marine plastic debris “with a goal to end marine plastic pollution by 2050” and to collectively join actions in marine plastic removal. There are also many issues of information asymmetry and mutual trust in the governance of marine resource protection, for example, within a marine debris recycling system, the relationship between the manufacturing industry and marine debris, the increased cost of petrochemical plastic manufacturers in reducing marine debris, issues of trust in the government in promoting plastic reduction, the lack of the credit information of recyclers by cooperating financial institutions, the low willingness to participate by environmental recycling agencies in marine protection due to the high cost of marine debris removal, and issues of cooperation between the industry and the government in decision-making processes. These issues cause difficulties in introducing reform policies, such as, in respect of adjustments of guaranteed prices for marine debris recycling, and income insurance (assurance) policies for fishermen for their assistance in marine debris recycling. Promoting policies can encounter great difficulties as well, such as promoting policies in respect of adjustments of marine debris removal policies, classifications of marine debris recycling, marking systems for qualified recyclers for product conversions, and non-project based fishermen loans for marine debris recycling, etc. If blockchain technology can be used to solve the issues of information asymmetry and mutual trust among people, between manufacturers and consumers, among recycling agencies, manufacturers and fund providers, and between the people and the government, it will play a crucial role in introducing and implementing reform policies in marine resource conservation development. To demonstrate its determination in marine debris removal, the Ocean Affairs Council in Taiwan R.O.C. participated in the Presidential Hackathon 2020. With the theme of “Ocean Blockchain, Garbage Turning into Gold” and through the public-private collaboration, it proposed to use blockchain technology to connect volunteers and enterprises that would be willing to sponsor marine debris removal. In addition, based on the concept of a recycling economy of marine debris traceability, it was proposed that the collected information could be used in the future to establish hot spots for marine debris to call on all people for its removal, and, as a result, the quality of marine resource conservation could be improved to deal with the increasingly severe marine ecological destruction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to study the dynamics of bitcoin prices in Brazil, a large emerging economy with an unregulated bitcoin market. Design/methodology/approach: First, this study tests if the Law of One Price (LOOP) is valid for bitcoin prices in Brazil, conducting tests with data from three Brazilian exchanges. Next, this study documents bitcoin price dynamics in the short run by studying the price discovery mechanism in these exchanges. This study uses Information Share and Component Share, combining the two measures to obtain an Information Leadership Share (ILS) measure. Findings: This study finds a common trend within bitcoin prices among a set of exchanges, with cointegration tests between the price series indicating that LOOP is valid in Brazilian markets in the long run. ILS indicated that, for closing prices, the most liquid exchange (Foxbit) leads discovery, whereas the least liquid (Local Bitcoin) lags, with Mercado Bitcoin in the middle both in terms of discovery and liquidity. Finally, this study provides evidence that the price variation in the market that leads price discovery can be used to construct an arbitrage in another exchange. Originality/value: This research brings the first evidence of a price discovery mechanism for exchanges in Brazilian Reais. Although LOOP is valid in the long run, price leadership in bitcoin markets potentially create arbitrage opportunities in the short run. This study contributes to the growing literature of bitcoin prices with novel evidence from a large emerging economy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The meteoric ascent of the cryptocurrency market in the last two years has drawn a large number of both investors and bystanders (NDTV Business Desk, 2022). Nakamoto (2008, p.4) defines cryptocurrency as "a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution." Bitcoin's public introduction in 2009 marked the beginning of the cryptocurrency economy. Bitcoin, a distributed digital cryptocurrency, is widely regarded as the first open and decentralized currency (Cousins et al., 2019). In just over a decade, the cryptocurrency market has grown to over 1.8T dollars (CoinMarketCap, 2022), which when compared to the gold market of 12.5T dollars, is quite significant. Many people mistakenly assume that crypto coins and tokens are the same things, but they are not. While at a basic level all cryptocurrencies are tokens, not all tokens are crypto coins. Coins are' tokens' that reside on and use their own blockchain to trade currency and store value. The most famous examples of coins are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which were created on their own developed blockchain systems. In contrast, tokens are applications that trade on preexisting blockchain systems (Momtaz, 2019). For example, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a crypto token that relies on the ETH blockchain (CoinMarketCap, 2022). Tokens, by their very nature, pose a much greater risk for the investor than do coins. The reason for this is that developers could create and launch a token on a preexisting blockchain with the intention to scam investors. An example of this was a crypto token based on the famous South Korean Netflix series, Squid Game, that was successfully launched, gained investors, collapsed, and was later proven to be a scam (BBC News, 2021). From a socio-technical and multidisciplinary standpoint, an IS research framework is needed to better understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the challenges facing stakeholders (Sas & Khairuddin, 2017). In this study, we want to answer the research question, what are the differences between individual investors' intention to invest between crypto coins and crypto tokens? We will explore factors motivating investors such as the risk of investing, trust in coins and tokens, and profit expectancy in order to better understand the different attitudes and motivations for investors when choosing coins and/or tokens. © 2022 28th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2022.

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency markets have experienced large growth in recent years, with an increase in the number and diversity of traded assets. Previous work has addressed the economic properties of Bitcoin with regards to its hedging or diversification properties. However, the surge of many alternatives, applications, and decentralized finance services on a variety of blockchain networks requires a re-examination of those properties, including indexes from outside the big economies and the inclusion of a variety of cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we report the results of studying the most representative cryptocurrency of each consensus mechanism by trading volume, forming a list of twenty-four cryptocurrencies from the 1st of January 2018 to the 30th of September 2022. Using the Baur and McDermott model, we examine hedge, safe haven, and diversifier properties of all assets for all G7 country’s major indexes as well as all BRICS major indexes breaking it down by two attributes: kind of blockchain technology and pre/during COVID health crisis. Results show that both attributes play an important role in the hedge, safe haven, and diversifier properties associated with the asset. Concretely: stablecoins appear to be the only ones to maintain hedge property in most analyzed markets pre- and during-COVID; Bitcoin investment properties shifted after the COVID crisis started; China and Russia stopped being correlated with the cryptocurrency after the COVID crisis hit. © 2022 by the authors.},

It may replace gold as a hedge against inflation and become a new investment asset for financial management. The investment relationship with gold has increasingly important research value and practical significance. This paper modeled daily price flow data from 11 September 2016 to 10 September 2021 to help market traders determine whether they need to buy, hold, or sell assets in their portfolios daily. The model predicts price fluctuations through linear regression prediction of machine learning, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. In the linear regression prediction, the goodness of fit of gold is 89.44%, and the goodness of fit of Bitcoin is 98.43%. In the test set prediction of KNN algorithm, the goodness of fit of gold is 97.25%, and the goodness of fit of Bitcoin is 95.06%. Based on this, the optimal investment strategy and the initial investment value are obtained. Empirical analysis shows that bitcoin price volatility and gold price volatility have a strong substitution effect; gold and currency used will be a suitable combination of hedging, which will bring momentum for the development of the market economy and become an important force in the sustainable development of a high-quality-driven economy. © 2022 by the authors.},

Exploiting cross-country variation in prescheduled announcement timing, I isolate how monetary policy announcements affect local Bitcoin demand using an event-study design on a panel of 26 emerging economies. I find that monetary policy announcements increase both measures of local Bitcoin attention and local Bitcoin trade volume, but only on days when the public is abnormally attentive to inflation. These announcement-induced Bitcoin trading spikes are only significant in countries that are not normally accustomed to inflation risk. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the investment of large-scale and high-speed informatization under the traditional institutional framework, serious information islands have been caused. Therefore, the establishment of data models for the agricultural economy has become an urgent requirement for the construction of agricultural economic informatization. With the rise of Bitcoin in China, the region Block chain (BC) technology has entered people’s sight, providing new possibilities for the establishment of agricultural economic management data models. Based on this, this article carried out a research on the establishment of a data model for agricultural economic management based on BC technology. This article elaborates on the establishment of a data model based on BC technology. Through an overview of BC in technology, it introduces the technical characteristics of the BC itself, and discusses several possible application scenarios of BC technology, and explains the working principle of BC technology used in agricultural economic management shows the characteristics and advantages of decentralized management. This article is aimed at the problems of data sharing in the economic network, combined with the scalability of the information technology on the BC and the privacy protection solution we proposed to use the BC to classify the nodes of each agricultural unit and department connected, data exchange is carried out through the platform, and the authenticity and reliability of the data exchange is ensured and it is not maliciously tampered with. The investigation and research results show that in the experiments of the paillier cryptosystem system in this paper, as the total length of the key generated by it gradually increases, the number of calculations that must be required in the process of generating the key gradually increases, and its increasing time and rate gradually increase by 67%; as the total length of the key decreases, the time spent in the encryption and decryption process will gradually decrease, the amount of calculation in the encryption and decryption process gradually increases by 127%, and the time required for decryption and decryption as the key length changes exponentially. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The present study also investigates areas related to cryptocurrency, such as people's trust in banks. The results from the survey are contrasted with other countries to obtain a global perspective regarding Morocco's placement in the cryptocurrency adoption spectrum. The results also suggest that Morocco has the potential to adopt this technology. Notably, 9% of the sample population claim that they have owned, or still own, some sort of cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and other version of it (known as Altcoins) are traded everyday at various cryptocurrency exchanges and have drawn the interest of many investors. These new type of assets are characterised by wild swings in prices and this can lead to great profit as well as large losses. To respond to these dynamics, crypto investors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of optimal portfolio selection. This paper presents a portfolio selection based on COGARCH and regular vine copula which are able to capture features such as abrupt jumps in prices, heavy-tailed distribution and dependence structure respectively, with the optimal portfolio achieved through the stochastic heuristic algorithm differential evolution known for its global search solution ability. This method shows great performance as compared with other available models and can achieve up to 50% of total returns in some periods of optimization. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

Daily time series data on four different types of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and BMB) were employed. The data covers the period from 1 January 2019–31 December 2021. The study employed the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC GARCH) and Bayesian liner regression model to investigate time-varying correlations among the variables. Empirical findings suggest that stock market volatility has a positive impact on the returns of BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, it has a negative impact on Tether. Expectedly, cybercrime poses negative impacts on the returns of BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum but could be said to have no impact on the returns of Tether. The study concludes that ongoing efforts to reduce cybercrime activities need to be strengthened to further the use of digital currencies. © 2022 by the authors.},

To that end, To meet the study’s aim, a range of general methods, including descriptive, comparison, analysis and observational methods are utilize. According to the results, the exchange rate fluctuations of bitcoin to the US dollar and bitcoin to the euro are synchronous, which to a greater extent indicates the actual absence of the impact of bitcoin on the world's fiat money. At the same time, the cross-rates of fiat currencies are in direct interaction, which confirms the actual absence of the impact of bitcoin on the stability of the euro or dollar monetary currencies.

The main explanation for the adoption of stablecoins is their one-to-one peg to various currencies and commodities. Previous studies have relied on the relationships among cryptocurrencies and thus could not disentangle the country-level macroeconomic effects of stablecoins from the effects of other cryptocurrencies. Using data from January 2006 to December 2019, we decompose the correlation between cryptocurrencies and their effects on the economy due to (a) shocks to stablecoins and (b) shocks to Bitcoin. Contrary to assumptions, stablecoins do not maintain their peg in “crash times” but do promote economic growth. Bitcoin's volatility deanchors investor expectations, disrupts markets, and destabilizes key macroeconomic factors. Our novel findings indicate that stablecoin adoption should not be based only on a one-to-one assumption and reveal the mechanism of key gaps by a prudential authority. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

A dearth study of measuring central banks' interest rate as Bitcoin determinants is the main research problem we aim to solve and hence produce the originality/value of this research. The COVID-19 factors utilized are COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths. We further used the interest rate as a moderator variable. Feasible Generalized Least Square (FGLS) and moderated regression are applied as the first and second stage methodologies, respectively. We collected daily data from 2 March 2020 - 12 March 2021 and hence the total observations are 1,350. Focusing on the ASEAN-5 countries, this research found that Bitcoin can be an alternative investment. However, its character as a speculative asset may decrease investors' interest in Bitcoin when the condition is highly uncertain. Interest rate affects inversely on Bitcoin but insignificant. Surprisingly, the interest rate revealed a stronger inverse impact as a moderator variable to the Bitcoin price. Therefore, investors and central banks are highly suggested to watch the current condition for a better investment decision making and monetary policy adjustment to control and stabilize the economy. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The influence of technology and developing information is indeed extraordinary on human life. Economic development is also inseparable from the growing technology, for example in transaction procedures in a matter. Bitcoin came up with a new innovation in the form of a cryptocurrency that uses a payment network from user to user. Crypto has become a phenomenon nowadays. Based on the results of the Global Web Index Survey, 10% of internet users in Indonesia already own digital currencies, it can be said that Indonesia is ranked 5th most crypto users in the world. Crypto or can be called crytocurrency has a fairly high risk. Then kirpto has a change in value that is only enthusiasm at any time. Krip toalso has a lack of regulation and still leaves legality issues. This research was conducted to determine the existence of bitcoin trading to the national economy. The use of bitcoin over time is increasing in Indonesia. For this reason, before the use of bitcoin is increasing, we must understand the influence and impact of bitcoin trading on the national economy. Only nine countries have legalized bitcoin, it is questionable why many countries have not legalized bitcoin. This study aims to find out how bitcoin trading conditions in Indonesia. The results of this journal will discuss the effect of bitcoin trading on the national economy even though in Indonesia it is prohibited and recognized as legal tender. This can be viewed from several factors such as from the nominal side of bitcoin, which is considered excessive, especially in the picture of the economic crisis. © 2022 Author(s).},

Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

It provides a broader view of the entire dependence structure between the forex markets and digital currencies than traditional methods. Our empirical analysis indicates a positive connection between foreign exchange currencies and cryptocurrencies for all nine currencies, particularly Bitcoin, at low, high, and middle tail quantiles. However, differences are present between economies and across quantiles of virtual currencies and fiat currencies for each economy. This heterogeneity is due to variations in economic structure, legal recognition by governments, associated risk, and monetary or macroeconomic policy changes that affect the trading of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. © 2022},

	abstract = {Time series prediction methods based on deep learning have been widely used in quantitative trading. However, the price of virtual currency represented by Bitcoin has random fluctuation characteristics, which is extremely misleading for time series prediction. In this paper, a virtual currency quantitative trading model is established, which uses a convolution long short term memory (ConvLSTM) deep learning method to predict the transaction price, and uses the evaluation model composed of Chandler momentum oscillator (CMO), percentage price oscillator (PPO), stop and reverse(SAR) and other economic indicators to make further decisions. The model quantitatively classifies the random wandering characteristics by fusing economic indicators and extracts the symmetric economic laws among them, making full use of deep learning methods to extract spatial and temporal features within the data. The 2016–2021 Bitcoin value dataset published on Kaggle was used for simulated investment. The results show that compared with other existing decision models, it shows better performance and robustness, and shows good stability in dealing with the interdependence of long-term and short-term data. Our work provides a new idea for short-term prediction of long time series data affected by multiple complex factors: coupling deep learning methods with prior knowledge to complete prediction and decision making. © 2022 by the authors.},

The electronic economy is very dangerous and must be approached with great caution, so as to avoid or minimize the risks that occur in such cases. Deep neural network (DNN) algorithm was improved to predict the Bitcoin price and then achieve the main goal of reducing financial risks to proceed with electronic business, and good estimation was achieved by using informative data such as transactions and currency return. The proposed method extracted features of related Bitcoin and used the informative ones. Transaction plan considered building nodes in terms of network. Development of deep learning algorithms opens the horizons for the development of electronic businesses that use digital currency.

This analysis was enhanced from the authors’ own experiences in real-world Blockchain implementations. Results revealed that Blockchain is a highly innovative approach to secure transaction execution, information storage, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open architectural environment.

This study investigated Bitcoin’s persistence and hedging properties in the pre-COVID era to establish its efficiency and safety by testing relevant data. We evaluated the role of persistence in Bitcoin trading to highlight its efficiency. The GPH estimator and ARFIMA were used to map the evolving efficiency of the Bitcoin price. Our analysis of intra-day data exhibited the presence of an anti-persistence effect, following the popular conclusion of momentum and speculative trading in the Bitcoin market. The second section of this study evaluated whether Bitcoin played the role of a hedge and an asset of protection in a global portfolio manager’s portfolio during extreme market volatility. Using the Threshold GARCH (TGARCH), we evaluated the trading correlation between Bitcoin prices and four major indices, namely S & P 500, FTSE, Hang Seng, and Nikkei, on daily and weekly data. We identified the time-varying hedge and safety properties of Bitcoin: Volatility, speculation, less-traded history, and lack of regulatory infrastructure. Our findings added to the literature by testing the efficiency of Bitcoin in major developed economies using returns of high-frequency data, along with daily returns. We also considered extreme movements in the currency to check its hedging and protection properties in a portfolio of developed market stocks. We recommended that investors be cautious when combining this currency with different stock markets based on our findings. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

The recent and ongoing COVID pandemic provides an opportunity to assess how crtypocurrency fares as a store of value, as the pandemic has disrupted economies, possibly inducing speculative motives for holding cryptocurrency. This paper sought to establish if Bitcoin and Ethereum generated any excess returns over the recent time period covering the pandemic. Parameter estimates from a Capital Asset Pricing Model revealed that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum realized excess returns during the COVID pandemic. This suggests that to the extent that a standard and generally acceptable medium of exchange has a speculative component to its demand, crytopcurency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may not be good candidates as a medium of exhhange. © 2022, Nigerian Economic Society.

	abstract = {Although NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and cryptocurrencies are active on the same market, their prices are not so closely related over time. The objective of this paper is to identify the relationship between the two types of assets (NFTs and the cryptocurrencies Ethereum, Crypto Coin, and Bitcoin), using data for the period between September 2020 until February 2022. The conclusions of the study are useful for cryptocurrency and NFT issuers, but also for investors on the financial market who are reconfiguring their portfolios with increasing frequency, and use these new assets for speculative or hedging purposes based on blockchain technology. The results highlighted relationships between NFTs and Ethereum, between Ethereum and Crypto Coin, and between Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ethereum being a bridge between all four. Therefore, NFTs present a relationship with Ethereum, the NFTs price had a causal effect on the price of Ethereum. © 2022 by the authors.},

For this purpose, by adopting the social network analysis methodological approach, it considers the geographical network of Bitcoin transactions as a proxy to measure the national level of fintech development and compares it with a set of economic freedom indicators related to the top 70 world economies. The analysis revealed significant relationships between the performed network centrality measures and national levels of economic freedom. In particular, as confirmed by the implemented multilevel regression models, high levels of freedom to trade internationally combined with a restrained value of inflation and low administrative requirements can be considered as determining factors for fintech development. The study also showed a large number of Bitcoin transactions conducted in those countries characterized by fewer capital controls and restrictions, a result that feeds suspicions of illegal behavior, such as money laundering or terrorism financing, carried out through the use of cryptocurrencies. Findings of this research might be strategic for fintech entrepreneurship and policymakers interested in designing policies that aim to foster innovative sectors while ensuring the legality of financial flows. © 2019, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.},

This has frequently been conducted on Twitter data in particular. Using data mining techniques, opinion mining, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge management, the underlying public mood states and sentiment can be uncovered. As cryptocurrencies play an increasingly significant role in global economies, there is an evident relationship between Twitter sentiment and future price fluctuations in Bitcoin. This paper assesses Tweets' collection, manipulation, and interpretation to predict early market movements of cryptocurrency. More specifically, sentiment analysis and text mining methods, including Logistic Regressions, Binary Classified Vector Prediction, Support Vector Mechanism, and Naive Bayes, were considered. Each model was evaluated on their ability to predict public mood states as measured by 'tweets' from Twitter during the era of covid-19. An XGBoost-Composite ensemble model is constructed, which achieved higher performance than the state-of-the-art prediction models. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the international markets, financial variables can be volatile and may affect each other, especially in the crisis times. COVID-19, which began in China in 2019 and spread to many countries of the world, created a crisis not only in the global health system but also in the international financial markets and economy. The purpose of this study is to analyze the contagious effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volatility of selected financial variables such as Bitcoin, gold, oil price, and exchange rates and the connections between the volatilities of these variables during the pandemic. For this aim, we use the ARMA-EGARCH model to measure the impact of volatility and shocks. In other words, it is aimed to measure whether the impact of the shock on the financial variables of the contagiousness of the epidemic is also transmitted to the markets. The data was collected from secondary and daily data from September 2th 2019 to December 20th, 2020. It can be said that the findings obtained have statistically significant effects on the conditional variability of the variables. Therefore, there are findings that the shocks in the market are contaminated with each other. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

The method used to collect the data is a questionnaire. The results showed that variables such as subjective norms, security risk, perception of utility, and enjoyment influence the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. These variables include the perception of pleasure as well as the perception of utility. Copyright © 2021. Saad ALAKLABI and Kyeong KANG.

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are breakthrough financial technologies that promise to revolutionize the digital economy. Unfortunately, their long-term adoption in the business world is imperiled by a lack of stability that manifests as dramatic swings in transaction fees and severe participant dissatisfaction. To date, there has been little academic effort to study how system participants react to volatility in fee movements. Our study addresses this research gap by conceptualizing the Bitcoin platform as a data space market and studying how market equilibrium forms between users who demand data space while trying to avoid transaction delays, and miners who supply data space while trying to maximize fee revenues. Our empirical analysis based on past bitcoin transactions reveals the existence of a relatively flat downward-sloping demand curve and a much steeper upward-sloping supply curve. Regarding users, the inelastic nature of demand signals the utility of Bitcoin as a niche platform for transactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct. This result challenges the belief that users may easily abandon Bitcoin technology given rising transaction costs. We also find that the use of bitcoins as a trading asset is associated with higher levels of tolerance to fees. Regarding miners, the comparatively elastic nature of supply indicates that higher fees stimulate mining by a larger magnitude than suppressing demand. This finding implies that, ceteris paribus, the Bitcoin system turns to self-regulate transaction fees in an efficient manner. Our work has implications for the management of congestion in blockchain-based systems and more broadly for the stability of cryptocurrency markets. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

	abstract = {The Fourth industrial revolution has seen many innovative technologies that are now challenging traditional economies. The innovative and technological financial instruments are inspiring individuals and expert investors to investigate the broader investment spectrum, and consequently diversify their portfolios. Going beyond the conventional portfolios and developing state-of-the-art strategies that comply with the ever-changing financial and technological advancements are the keys to long term sustainability. Therefore, to cater to the needs of all segments of the society, the investment strategies during the fourth industrial revolution demand exposure to technological and digital financial innovations. This study investigates the impact of diversification with the addition of five cryptocurrencies from November 2015 to November 2019 on four traditional asset portfolios. The results show that the diversification increased the returns in most of the cases, and reduced the portfolio volatility in all portfolios, and also provided higher returns as compared to the traditional portfolios for the same level of risk. This study also revealed that the results might improve when short sales are allowed. Moreover, we can conclude that the addition of multiple cryptocurrencies in a portfolio provides enhanced results for diversification, and Ethereum provides a better diversification opportunity as compared to Bitcoin. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Based on the unprecedented development of current information technology, under the prevalence of third-party payment, in order to increase the utilization rate of idle resources and meet the diversified economic needs of today's era, as an emerging economic model-the "sharing economy", combined with Internet big data, it has effectively realized the perfect connection between supply and demand, and it has quickly swept through all walks of life. However, while promoting economic development, the lack of regulatory measures and the imperfect credit system have severely restricted the further development of the sharing economy. Blockchain technology (BT), as a new distributed infrastructure and computing method, has always been the core technology of Bitcoin. Based on the development of generalized economic model and BT, this paper analyzes the shortcomings of generalized economic model and blockchain technology through information fusion big data and proposes a kind of information based on information fusion big data+public BT. The security management system adapts to the status quo of the sharing economy and uses the functions of information fusion big data+blockchain technology to solve the current information security risks faced by the sharing economy. The experimental results of this article show that the sharing economy information security management system based on information fusion big data+blockchain technology has good protection capabilities. The interception rate of external information reached 95%, and the interception rate of system information reached 93%. Better protection of privacy leaks is needed.  © 2021 Jian Xiao.},

	abstract = {The global crude oil market has experienced a significant downturn following the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in December 2019. Thereafter, all the major oil markets have become extremely volatile, and investments in these markets could lead to substantial losses. This paper empirically investigates the time-varying correlations between gold and oil markets to examine whether gold is a safe haven asset for the international crude oil markets during the COVID-19 period. For the purpose of comparison, the safe haven property of Bitcoin is tested as well. The results of the time-varying correlations obtained through the DCC-GARCH model suggest that gold is a safe haven asset for global crude oil markets. Bitcoin, on the other hand, acts only as a diversifier for crude oil. The results further show that the portfolio risk is minimized when investors include oil and gold in their portfolio rather than holding assets in oil and Bitcoin markets. Given that financial downturn, terrorist attacks, pandemics and similar global events often play a crucial role in portfolio risk analysis, our results could be of interest to those who invest in oil, gold and Bitcoin markets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The reliability, relevance and timeliness of the accounting information provided by the company's financial reports are obviously insufficient, and the efficiency of capital market accounting supervision has been greatly reduced. In the digital economy era, traditional double-entry accounting and financial accounting reports are no longer sufficient to serve the new economy, and it is imperative to reconstruct the accounting information disclosure system. This article attempts to implement the nine-character policy of capital market reform (system building, nonintervention, zero tolerance). Firstly, it is necessary to reconstruct the accounting information disclosure system based on blockchain technology; and under the background of the system with less government intervention, various entities automatically realize the maintenance of distributed ledger and the disclosure of financial accounting information, based on the principle of self-interest. Finally, in addition to legal restrictions, it is more difficult for untrustworthy persons to participate in the maintenance of distributed ledger, in order to increase their economic costs and achieve zero tolerance for them.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper is saddled with the task of investigating the Bitcoin market behavior in the presence of a government risk. This is because both the institutional and retail investors’ interests in the Bitcoin market are growing rapidly. Conversely, the seemingly unregulated nature of this market is a serious concern to most economies and results to the placement of ban on Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in some economies by the government. Daily series of return and volume within the window of the ICO ban in China was used for the Bitcoin market and S&P500 stock market to examine the effect of a government risk in the Bitcoin market and possible hedging capabilities. Empirical results show that the ban dampened Bitcoin returns and the returns from each market can predict the other. The Exogenous Dynamic Conditional Correlation (Exo-DCC) model result suggests that, yes! the S&P500 stocks are capable of hedging Bitcoin risk, while Bitcoin can also hedge S&P500 stocks’ risks and vice versa. The Exogenous BEKK (Exo-BEKK) model result shows evidence of bidirectional volatility spill over between the two markets studied. In practice, investors (institutions and retailers) can comfortably form a robust investment portfolio with (at least) these two assets and develop a hedging strategy, such that the impacts of risks on the portfolio’s returns are safely hedged. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. corrected publication 2019.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a new approach to mobile money, a money transfer solution via mobile phone, which uses accounts associated with Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) identifiers, and which is managed by the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). The first solution M-PESA launched in Kenya in 2007 is one of the world’s major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MNOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently, in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs (CFA franc, officially African Financial Community franc) per day. The Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) is the heart technology of mobile money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The rate of unbanked is so high in developing countries that it does not favor economy development. According to the World Bank, mobile money contributes to skip this obstacle. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art of mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries in general, and in Burkina-Faso particularly. We propose a mobile money solution based on the blockchain, in order to increase security, trust, and move towards a federation of mobile money platforms. © 2021, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {A completely new economic system is required for the era of Industry 4.0. Blockchain technology and blockchain cryptocurrencies are the best means to confront this new trustless economy. Millions of smart devices are able to complete transparent financial transactions via blockchain technology and its related cryptocurrencies. However, via blockchain technology, internet‐connected devices may be hacked to mine cryptocurrencies. In this regard, monitoring the network of these blockchain‐based transactions can be very useful to detect the abnormal behavior of users of these cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the transactions can be assured. In this paper, a novel procedure is proposed to monitor the network of blockchain cryptocurrency transactions. To do so, a hidden Markov multi‐linear tensor model (HMTM) is utilized to model the transactions among nodes of the blockchain network. Then, a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control chart is applied to the monitoring of the latent effects. Average run length (ARL) is used to evaluate the performance of the MEWMA control chart in detecting blockchain network anomalies. The proposed procedure is applied to a real dataset of Bitcoin transactions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies often tend to maintain a publically accessible ledger of all transactions. This open nature of the transactional ledger allows us to gain macroeconomic insight into the USD 1 Trillion crypto economy. In this paper, we explore the free market-based economy of eight major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, ZCash, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic. We specifically focus on the aspect of wealth distribution within these cryptocurrencies as understanding wealth concentration allows us to highlight potential information security implications associated with wealth concentration. We also draw a parallel between the crypto economies and real-world economies. To adequately address these two points, we devise a generic econometric analysis schema for cryptocurrencies. Through this schema, we report on two primary econometric measures: Gini value and Nakamoto Index which report on wealth inequality and 51% wealth concentration respectively. Our analysis reports that, despite the heavy emphasis on decentralization in cryptocurrencies, the wealth distribution remains in-line with the real-world economies, with the exception of Dash. We also report that 3 of the observed cryptocurrencies (Dogecoin, ZCash, and Ethereum Classic) violate the honest majority assumption with less than 100 participants controlling over 51% wealth in the ecosystem, potentially indicating a security threat. This suggests that the free-market fundamentalism doctrine may be inadequate in countering wealth inequality within a crypto-economic context: Algorithmically driven free-market implementation of these cryptocurrencies may eventually lead to wealth inequality similar to those observed in real-world economies.

	abstract = {An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a funding mechanism used by projects to sell their crypto-token in exchange for Bitcoin, Ether, etc. It is the counterpart of the Initial Public Offering in the new digital currency economy. ICOs help projects to be funded in a short time with a high-profit margin. The primary purpose of this study is isolating the principal factors that affect the decision to invest in an ICO. A large array of potential signals, consisting of promotion and marketing effects, investor motivation, founder team effects, whitepaper and ICO specific factors, are considered in an online survey and the responses are analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The results of the analysis reveal five composite principal factors that determine the decision to invest in an ICO. These five principal factors are the ICO whitepaper, websites for finance news and ICO listings, ICO project sector and founder, ICO project team and social media. Our findings provide a perspective to both investor and ICO founders about which factors to prioritize when deciding to launch an ICO or to invest in one. © 2020 Sciedu Press.},

	abstract = {Given the pace of development of the digital economy, companies' operations with crypto assets are an objective inevitability for most states. At the same time, national jurisdictions no longer have the opportunity to ignore the fact of business working with crypto assets. Meanwhile, without consensus in the consistent resolution of financial, tax, and other cross-country relations, operations with crypto assets can belong to the underground economy sphere to a large extent. In this regard, the issues of regulating macroeconomic factors when reflecting crypto assets in the structure of the current classification, the procedure for their fair valuation, taking into account the formation of classification and content construction in the financial statements of companies, are relevant. Another aspect is to conduct comprehensive analysis in order to consider scientific and practical approaches to the procedure of classification and evaluation of cryptographic assets in scientific research, professional judgments of major audit international organizations. In this regard, the study focuses on a practical analysis of the current accounting policies of companies operating with crypto assets, taking into account the position of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC). Based on the results of the conducted research, the existing models of classification and evaluation of crypto assets are assessed, and the most problematic practical aspects of their application are highlighted. This made it possible to propose promising models for managing the value of crypto assets, containing the existing practices currently used by companies and their possible directions. It was concluded that the most promising way out of the conflict of interests of business and the current rules of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to refine the existing standards, introduce rules of classification and evaluation of crypto assets. The authors also do not exclude that the best solution is to develop a new IFRS standard for the accounting of crypto assets. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.},

Empirical investigations are executed through symmetric, asymmetric and non‐linear causality tests, and Markov regime‐switching regression (MRSR) analysis. Results show that Bitcoin has a causal nexus with Chinese yuan and Indian rupee for price and various return components. The MRSR analysis justifies these findings by demonstrating the presence of interaction in contractionary regimes. Accordingly, it can be stated that when markets display a downward trend, appreciation of the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee positively and strongly affects the value of Bitcoin, possibly due to the market timing. The MRSR analysis also exhibits a transition from a tranquil to a crisis regime in March 2020 because of the pandemic. However, a shorter duration spent in the crisis regime in 2020 indicates the limited and relatively less harmful effect of the pandemic on the cryptocurrency market when compared to the turmoil that occurred in 2018. © 2020 by the authors.

The extension is based on network models, which improve pure autoregressive models, introducing a contemporaneous contagion component that describes contagion effects between trading volumes.

This article is an attempt to reveal the effects of policy uncertainty on Bitcoin returns with economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in the US, the UK, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, we also present the results of monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) on the Bitcoin market. The robust estimations from the quantile regression and Markov regime-switching model show that Bitcoin returns are affected by EPU. One of the essential findings is that Bitcoin returns are more responsive to EPU in the US, China, and Japan. In the US and Japan, uncertainty has a negative effect on the Bitcoin market whereas in China it has a positive effect. Global MPU uncertainty is also significant in explaining Bitcoin exchange rates. Moreover, the Bitcoin market is negatively affected by uncertainty in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the gross domestic product, and other macroeconomic data. Uncertainty in the equity market and Bitcoin returns are negatively associated. © 2020 The Author},

The aim of the research is to study the series of the dynamics of the price of bitcoin and the frequency of online requests for bitcoin as an indicator of the behavior of agents of the digital economy using the methods of qualitative recurrent analysis. The types of constructed time series plots of the price of bitcoin and the frequency of requests for bitcoin are defined as drift with a superimposed linearly gradually increasing sequence, which indicates the unpredictability of the behavior of digital economy agents with a gradual stabilization in new quality trend. The scientific novelty of the research results lies in the proven connection between the series of bitcoin price dynamics and the frequency of online requests for bitcoin, tracking changes in the behavior of digital economy agents before and after the introduction of quarantine restrictions. The procedure for conducting a qualitative recurrence analysis of the series of dynamics is generalized, which takes into account the specifics of the formation of the frequency of online requests for bitcoin, the price and the behavioral aspect of its formation. The practical value lies in defining the characterization of the behavior model of digital economy agents under conditions of quarantine restrictions. The behavior of digital economy agents in the context of COVID-19 requires further research, in particular, using cross-recurrent analysis methods. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected world economies. In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing. © 2020},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is considered to be an exclusive marvel of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and is one of the most sophisticated technological and financial products. It has long been a pivot point of attention for investors who are in pursuit of a safe haven asset. In this paper, we use the wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile method, and the quantile-based Granger causality method, in order to investigate the notion of Bitcoin in actually being a safe-haven asset, amid political and economic uncertainty in the US for the period between 2010:M06, and 2020:M10. Using the Partisan Conflict Index (PCI), and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) as proxies of uncertainties, we find that although Bitcoin effectively appears to be a safe haven asset when uncertainties are on the rise, however, this relationship tends to change during the short- to long-run. In this regard, our sample provides us with a unique opportunity to evaluate the safe haven hypothesis for Bitcoin, amid a time span with three Presidential elections in the US, and recently, an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, which has been declared as a global pandemic. We have also supplemented our analysis with the bootstrap rolling window causality method, as a measure of robustness. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic economic situation, our work provides valuable knowledge for investors, who wish to construct investment portfolios based on Bitcoin, and also provide insights for regulators about how to regulate the cryptocurrency speculation in an effective manner. © 2021},

	abstract = {We analyzed cryptocurrency dynamics in the global U.S. dollar–denominated market and the emerging market economies (EMEs) with a view to ascertaining whether activities in these markets are predominantly shaped by reinforcement or substitution effect. Cryptocurrencies analyzed include the Bitcoins, Ethereum, Litecoin, Steller, Bitcoin Cash, and USD Tether. The results suggest that, on average, correlation between digital assets in the cryptocurrencies’ ecosystem is positive. However, there is evidence of an outlier with respect to the USD Tether (USDT) in the global market, revealing that the USDT is negatively associated with all other cryptocurrencies. This is supported by the dynamic regression results that provided evidence of reinforcement effect in favor of the USDT in the global crypto market, thus confirming the status of the USDT as “Stablecoin” as it is pegged 1:1 to USD. In the global market context, the results also revealed that USDT/USD returns had identical outliers that could portend lesser chances of extreme gains or losses compared with suggestions of extreme gains or losses in the EMEs. Furthermore, USDT did not seem to have similar evolution in the EMEs where it had relatively marginal influence in the markets. The vector error correction (VEC) estimate showed mixed results between Altcoins in all the markets; moreover, our finding showed that reinforcement effects hold in favor of Steller (XLM) both in the Russian ruble and Indian rupee crypto markets, whereas the Chinese yuan crypto market was predominantly characterized by substitution effect in favor of Bitcoin. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of cryptocurrency as a new phenomenon in the modern global economic processes and legal institutions. The relevance of the study is predetermined by the very specifics of such a phenomenon as cryptocurrency consisting of a distributed ledger technology, which determines the peculiarities of issuing, storing and performing operations with cryptocurrency. Moreover, the cryptocurrency turnover directly correlates with the national legislation of individual countries, which are the subject of domestic regulation with currency, tax legislation and legislation on the securities market. Sometimes, in this regard, there is a clash of public interests and the interests of entities involved in the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, as an unconventional, trendy phenomenon of the recent times, has become the object of research and discussions on all the world platforms, starting with academia, continuing with the business community and ending with state institutions. There are many reasons for explaining such interest and they can all be reduced to two main blocks: the advantages and the disadvantages of cryptocurrency circulation. The problem of cryptocurrency turnover, on the one hand, is that until now none of the national economies have regulated the cost-effective mechanism for the cryptocurrency turnover and, on the other hand, the leading countries have not yet set up an effective system of legal regulation of cryptocurrency. Many countries are in the active process of working to adequately address the above problem. Separately, it is worth highlighting the interest of Muslim countries in this issue, where discussions are still underway about the permissibility of cryptocurrency in Islamic law. As for the Russian realities in the context of the issue under study, the Federal Law “On Digital Financial Assets, Digital Currency and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation“, which came into effect on 1 January 2021, was supposed to streamline relations of subjects including cryptocurrencies, but, according to the experts in this field, this law is far from impeccable and this sphere of relations cannot be quickly and effectively regulated. This article describes the characteristics of cryptocurrency, its essence, disadvantages and advantages as an object of economic and civil law relations. The purpose of the research is to analyze the economic and legal phenomenon of cryptocurrency, as well as its characteristics in the Muslim legal system. The complexity of the work should be emphasized as a novelty. Based on the designated goal and the logic of construction, the study consists of three interrelated parts. The first part outlines the characteristics of cryptocurrency as an economic category, the second part is devoted to its legal analysis and the last part of the study demonstrates the Islamic perception (Sharia analysis) of this phenomenon. As a conclusion on the scientific research, we will highlight the following provisions. First, economically, nowadays, cryptocurrency is a rather controversial financial instrument: on the one hand, it has great investment attractiveness, but on the other hand, it is subject to great volatility and seems to be a rather risky financial asset. Secondly, from a legal standpoint, cryptocurrencies have not yet found their consistent consolidation and further legal regulation in the Russian legislation. It seems that the legal regulation of this institution will systematically develop depending on what application and results of its turnover the cryptocurrency will have in the future. Finally, the Islamic interpretation of the cryptocurrency phenomenon boils down to the absence of a single, consistent explanation of it from the perspective of Islam and Sharia as an object of permissibility (or prohibition) of transactions with it. It is necessary to further analyze the practice of using cryptocurrency and its impact on the economy and legal institutions in order to make a final decision on its permissibility or prohibition in correlation with the types of activity and the upcoming consequences associated with it. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {During the Coincheck incident, which recorded the largest damages in cryptocurrency history in 2018, it was demonstrated that using Mosaic token can have a certain effect. Although it seems attractive to employ tokens as countermeasures for cryptocurrency leakage, Mosaic is a specific token for the New Economy Movement (NEM) cryptocurrency and is not employed for other blockchain systems or cryptocurrencies. Moreover, although some volunteers tracked leaked NEM using Mosaic in the CoinCheck incident, it would be better to verify that the volunteers can be trusted. Simultaneously, if someone (e.g., who stole cryptocurrencies) can identify the volunteers, then that person or organization may be targets of them. In this paper, we propose an anonymous trust-marking scheme on blockchain systems that is universally applicable to any cryptocurrency. In our scheme, entities called token admitters are allowed to generate tokens adding trustworthiness or untrustworthiness to addresses. Anyone can anonymously verify whether these tokens were issued by a token admitter. Simultaneously, only the designated auditor and no one else, including nondesignated auditors, can identify the token admitters. Our scheme is based on accountable ring signatures and commitment, and is implemented on an elliptic curve called Curve25519, and we confirm that both cryptographic tools are efficient. Moreover, we also confirm that our scheme is applicable to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NEM. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy. Fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintech’s research challenges and trends. This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential. The novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology. Using the systematic literature review approach of Kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis fintech research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of fintech technology concepts and their development. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Online illicit marketplaces known as cryptomarkets have gained considerable attention from the media, government authorities, law enforcement agencies, and researchers. An increasing number of studies have investigated various aspects of these cryptomarkets' characteristics, such as product categories, sale volumes, and the number of listings and vendors. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding whether illegal transactions (of illicit drugs) take place during the day or week. This study fills this gap by tracing Bitcoin addresses associated with the six previously leading and most active cryptomarkets—Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution, Nucleus, and Abraxas—to identify the specific timings of these transactions. This study reveals clear patterns of activity on the marketplaces. First, transactions more often take place at night in European countries (Germany, Netherlands, the UK), the US, and Canada, where the cryptomarket drug trade is most active. Second, there are more transactions on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and fewer on Saturdays and Sundays. This indicates that the retail drug trade accounts for a large part of the cryptomarkets. Further, this study examines the impact of a cryptomarket policing effort known as Operation Onymous, and indicates that this policing effort only displaced users among these marketplaces and did not deter their activity, even in the short-term. It also suggests that Operation Onymous did not alter users’ transaction patterns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

However, a recent study [1] reported that approximately one-quarter of Bitcoin users and one-half of Bitcoin transactions are associated with illicit activity. Around US$72 billion of unlawful activity per year involves Bitcoin, which is close to the scale of the U.S. and European markets for illegal drugs. We have made an effort to understand and try our best to exhaustively discover Bitcoin mixing or tumbling services (essentially money laundering mechanisms) which exist or had existed. In our study, 69 services were identified, and evaluation of the public discussion around these services reveals certain trends in Bitcoin user understanding of privacy issues and enforcement of anti-money laundering regulation. So far, Law enforcement interference with Bitcoin laundering services is uncommon, while our study showed that most services failed due to lack of user trust. Trust is perhaps the greatest challenge amongst Bitcoin anonymization services, as many services that have existed appear to be outright scams, and even legitimate services sometimes disappear with user funds. We will report other observations and discussions at the end of the paper.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In the early 1990’s the so called Fuzzy Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ, SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This finding is consistent with previous studies and contributes to the ongoing discussion whether GP can be used as an indicator for aggregate market risk. Using variance decomposition, we also find that volatility in the gold and platinum market can influence Bitcoin volatility and that this relationship shows time-varying dependency. Finally, our results are robust to including new year effects and data of different frequency.

	abstract = {Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency which has largest market capitalization. The study aims to analyze the risk measures for the bitcoin and comparing with tradable asset classes that include the Standard and Poor’s BSE 500, USD, Euro, GBP and the Gold future prices. The study uses the GARCH models to identify the components of world economies that bitcoin is sensitive too as against variables that impact the global financial prudence. The empirical results of the study reveal that against dollar and euro exchange rates bitcoin returns are more sensitive. Bitcoin can be used together with gold to diversify or eliminate explicit market risks. The study presents reasonable justification over the development and relationship between bitcoin and different traded assets that pose new challenges before the global investors. The implication of this paper for the strategic policy makers shows the sensitivity among tradeable assets. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Still, cryptocurrencies have not yet become Decentralized Payment Systems (DPS) because of the high volatility of bitcoin and many of the altcoins. We investigated a proposed method to form a non-collateralized stablecoin called the Morini's Scheme of InvSav wallets. We figured out two equations for the rebasement for the Inv wallet balances and then compared the results. We found the second rebasement method to be fairer to the agents, but we found the issue of negative balances with both methods. We proposed novel solutions to overcome these issues. One of the proposed solutions was to freeze some money in the Sav wallet if there is a negative balance in the Inv wallet. Another proposed solution was to introduce a two-money economy of money and antimoney to turn the current centralized token distribution model decentralized and make transactions more probable even if agents do not have enough money funds; this could be seen as a decentralized version of credit cards. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Bitcoin lightning network (BLN), a so-called 'second layer' payment protocol, was launched in 2018 to scale up the number of transactions between Bitcoin owners. In this paper, we analyse the structure of the BLN over a period of 18 months, ranging from 12th January 2018 to 17th July 2019, at the end of which the network has reached 8.216 users, 122.517 active channels and 2.732,5 transacted Bitcoins. Here, we consider three representations of the BLN: the daily snapshot one, the weekly snapshot one and the daily-block snapshot one. By studying the topological properties of the binary and weighted versions of the three representations above, we find that the total volume of transacted Bitcoins approximately grows as the square of the network size; however, despite the huge activity characterising the BLN, the Bitcoins distribution is very unequal: the average Gini coefficient of the node strengths (computed across the entire history of the Bitcoin lightning network) is, in fact, ≃0.88 causing the 10% (50%) of the nodes to hold the 80% (99%) of the Bitcoins at stake in the BLN (on average, across the entire period). This concentration brings up the question of which minimalist network model allows us to explain the network topological structure. Like for other economic systems, we hypothesise that local properties of nodes, like the degree, ultimately determine part of its characteristics. Therefore, we have tested the goodness of the undirected binary configuration model (UBCM) in reproducing the structural features of the BLN: the UBCM recovers the disassortative and the hierarchical character of the BLN but underestimates the centrality of nodes; this suggests that the BLN is becoming an increasingly centralised network, more and more compatible with a core-periphery structure. Further inspection of the resilience of the BLN shows that removing hubs leads to the collapse of the network into many components, an evidence suggesting that this network may be a target for the so-called split attacks.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Cryptocurrencies, in particular, have developed as a haven for money laundering activity. Machine Learning can be used to detect these illicit patterns. However, labels are so scarce that traditional supervised algorithms are inapplicable. Here, we address money laundering detection assuming minimal access to labels. First, we show that existing state-of-the-art solutions using unsupervised anomaly detection methods are inadequate to detect the illicit patterns in a real Bitcoin transaction dataset. Then, we show that our proposed active learning solution is capable of matching the performance of a fully supervised baseline by using just 5% of the labels. This solution mimics a typical real-life situation in which a limited number of labels can be acquired through manual annotation by experts.  © 2020 Owner/Author.},

In the scientific literature, a clear focus on the high power consumption of the market-dominating Bitcoin can be seen in the sustainability assessment of cryptocurrencies. In order to build a comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrencies' sustainability other aspects should be considered as well instead of narrowing down the scope of analysis to power consumption. Therefore, a holistic definition of sustainability in the context of cryptocurrencies is proposed. Building upon this definition a methodology for assessing a cryptocurrencies' sustainability is derived in this paper and subsequently applied to ten cryptocurrencies. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

	abstract = {COVID-19 has morphed from a health crisis to an economic crisis that affected the global economy through several channels. This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on the time-frequency connectedness between Green Bonds and other financial assets. Our sample includes the global stock market, bond market, oil, USD index, and two popular hedging alternatives, namely Gold and Bitcoin, from May 2013 to August 2020. First, we apply the methodologies of Diebold and Yilmaz (International Journal of Forecasting, 2012, 28(1), 57–66) and Baruník and Křehlík (Journal of Financial Econometrics, 2018, 16(2), 271–296). Then, we estimate hedge ratios and hedge effectiveness of green bonds for other financial assets. Green bonds are found to have a great weight in the overall network, particularly strongly connected with the USD index and bond index. While the bi-directional relationship with USD persists during COVID, the connectedness with conventional bonds is also strengthened. Notably, we find a weak relationship between Green bonds and Bitcoin, both in the short and long run. As portfolio implications, Gold and USD have the highest hedge ratio, which is confirmed by the hedging effectiveness. In contrast, oil and stocks exhibit the lowest hedging effectiveness. Our findings imply that financial assets might have a heterogeneous relationship with green bonds. Furthermore, despite its infancy, it seems that the role of green bond during a crisis should not be ignored, as it can be a hedger for some assets, while a contagion amplifier during crisis times. © Copyright © 2021 Naeem, Mbarki, Alharthi, Omri and Shahzad.},

Firstly, by applying the dynamic time warping algorithm, we identify among several financial instruments a subsample of five assets with similar characteristics to the cryptocurrency bubble. Interestingly, among the fluctuations characterizing these assets, the algorithm shows a close affinity between the Bitcoin bubble and the 2000 NASDAQ Dotcom one. Once the subsample is identified, we study the (de)synchronization among these assets via the wavelet coherence approach. Although Bitcoin is poorly correlated with the other indices, given its scarce connection with the real economy, we observe switching phenomena among these instruments. A more careful study on these portfolio reallocations, conducted via an event study analysis, reveals that traders seem to redirect capital from stock markets and gold to Bitcoin in case of positive events of the cryptocurrency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is emerging as a key infrastructure technology that will lead the fourth industrial revolution, and blockchain promises to bring about revolutionary growth in almost all fields. Blockchain technology has the potential to lead social innovation that will improve the mutual harmony and understanding of the complex structures of human society as well as various phenomena (e.g.antagonism, confrontation, ideological conflict). It is also expected to be a very important infrastructure technology that can spur innovation in many fields of human society such as politics, economy, society, and culture. This paper provides an overview of the development environment and tools for developing and distributing the blockchain platform such as main terms, Remix, Truffle, Ganache, Metamask, blockchain as a service (BaaS) and other useful information. The paper also covers several configurations for the decentralized applications (DApp) of blockchain technology, which have been recently gaining much attention. In particular, we will focus on the Ethereum platform © Review Of International Geographical Education},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a virtual currency scheme that is characterised by a decentralised network and cryptographic transfer verification. It has attracted much public attention due to its innovative technology and its high currency exchange rate volatility. In this paper, Bitcoin’s exchange rate movement from 2011 to 2018 and its relationship with the global financial markets are explored using an EGARCH framework. The results are as follows. First, fundamentals and Bitcoin-related specific events play a critical role in the formation of its exchange rate. Second, the impact on Bitcoin of regulation-related events indicates that market sentiment responds to market regulation statements. Third, news coverage is an essential factor in driving its volatility. Fourth, Bitcoin can be a hedge in times of low uncertainty in global financial markets and can also serve as a safe haven against high economic uncertainty worldwide, but with increasing global financial uncertainty, it is likely to move with the markets and therefore cannot serve as a hedge or safe haven against stock market crashes. Lastly, the positive effect of global expansionary monetary policy on Bitcoin’s exchange rate is marginal enough to rule out the involvement of central banks worldwide in the inflation of Bitcoin’s exchange rate over the years, as may have been the case with many asset prices after the 2008 US financial crisis. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is built on a blockchain, an immutable decentralized ledger that allows entities (users) to exchange Bitcoins in a pseudonymous manner. Bitcoins are associated with alpha-numeric addresses and are transferred via transactions. Each transaction is composed of a set of input addresses (associated with unspent outputs received from previous transactions) and a set of output addresses (to which Bitcoins are transferred). Despite Bitcoin was designed with anonymity in mind, different heuristic approaches exist to detect which addresses in a specific transaction belong to the same entity. By applying these heuristics, we build an Address Correspondence Network: in this representation, addresses are nodes are connected with edges if at least one heuristic detects them as belonging to the same entity. In this paper, we analyze for the first time the Address Correspondence Network and show it is characterized by a complex topology, signaled by a broad, skewed degree distribution and a power-law component size distribution. Using a large-scale dataset of addresses for which the controlling entities are known, we show that a combination of external data coupled with standard community detection algorithms can reliably identify entities. The complex nature of the Address Correspondence Network reveals that usage patterns of individual entities create statistical regularities; and that these regularities can be leveraged to more accurately identify entities and gain a deeper understanding of the Bitcoin economy as a whole. © Copyright © 2021 Fischer, Palechor, Dell’Aglio, Bernstein and Tessone.},

	abstract = {As economies digitalize and many local businesses gradually internationalize, crowdfunding platforms have offered a new way for ventures to raise capital. Relying on distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain), the method of “tokenization” now seems to be the next way for digital economics to be actualised in practise. Digitalizing some of the production and selling processes through crypto-tokenization technology has brought with it new perspectives and opportunities. Any thorough consideration of the logic of “distributed systems” applied to economics is bound to see that it potentially brings considerable disruptions and significant changes in how companies get access to funding. Cryptocurrencies, and subsequently “tokens” initially issued from “initial coin offerings” (ICOs) have answered an obvious need for efficient, borderless, and secure flows of capital. This article first summarizes what early academic research tells us about ICOs based on DLTs and their factors of success. We then use the case of LakeDiamond, a Swiss venture in the business of growing and polishing synthetic diamonds, to present and contextualize the process of holding an ICO, which ultimately did not succeed. In the final section, we present two fund raising models that have recently gained traction and popularity, namely “security token offerings” (STOs) and “initial exchange offerings” (IEOs), and highlight their main advantages compared to ICOs. © 2020 Carleton University.

These underground markets exist in tension between two opposing forces: the drive to hide incriminating information, and the trust and stability benefits that greater openness yields. Revealing information about transactions to mitigate scams also provides valuable data about the market. We analyse the first dataset, of which we are aware, about the transactions created and completed on a well-known and high-traffic underground marketplace, Hack Forums, along with the associated threads and posts made by its users over two recent years, from June 2018 to June 2020. We use statistical modelling approaches to analyse the economic and social characteristics of the market over three eras, especially its performance as an infrastructure for trust. In the Set-up era, we observe the growth of users making only one transaction, as well as 'power-users' who make many transactions. In the Stable era, we observe a wide range of activities (including large-scale transfers of intermediate currencies such as Amazon Giftcards) which declines slowly from an initial peak. Finally, we analyse the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, concluding that while we see a significant increase in transactins across all categories, this reflects a stimulus of the market, rather than a transformation. New users overcome the 'cold start' problem by engaging in low-level currency exchanges to prove their trustworthiness. We observe currency exchange accounts for most contracts, and Bitcoin and PayPal are the preferred payment methods by trading values and number of contracts involved. The market is becoming more centralised over time around influential users and threads, with significant changes observed during the Set-up and Covid-19 eras. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the role of the Bitcoin currency, in avoiding and surpassing the risks that are associated with the global geopolitical events, and circumstances. For this purpose, we have performed the bootstrap full, and the sub-sample rolling-window Granger causality tests, in order to explore the mutual influences between geopolitical risks (GPR) and Bitcoin prices (BCP). We have found that there are positive and negative influences that stem from GPR towards BCP. In this regard, the positive impacts ascertain that the Bitcoin currency can be considered as an asset that is developed in order to avoid GPR. However, this view cannot be held constant and absolute, without considering the negative effects of such an arrangement. Moreover, it is noteworthy that these results are not supported by the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM), which highlights that BCP can be positively affected by GPR. On the flipside, there is a positive influence extended from BCP towards GPR, which suggests that the Bitcoin market is a leading indicator that can be used to analyze the global geopolitical environment more accurately and comprehensively. Therefore, in situations involving severe global uncertainty and complicated geopolitical patterns, investors can benefit from the Bitcoin market in order to optimize their investments during the periods where the GPR are higher. Moreover, governments can also adopt, accept and boost the trend of BCP by considering valid GPR, and further promote the advances in encryption technology. They can also strengthen their supervision, in order to promote a healthy development of the Bitcoin market, which in turn is a significant indicator of the macroeconomic and political trends across the globe. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Since emerging in 2009, cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have captured the imaginations of many investors and users in accumulating private wealth detached from government control and oversight. This article examines how the rise of bitcoin has particular geographies and trajectories of uneven development across the globe. The generation (or ‘mining’) of cryptocurrencies is computationally-intensive, requiring computer hardware, cool air and cheap energy. Adopting the case study of Quebec, Canada, we show how these variables interact to produce a relationship between digital currencies, economic imaginaries and space in the regions where cryptomining is clustered. We argue that these new geographies of cryptocurrency ‘mining’ leave residual marks on the regions where they are located but remain highly mobile – moving from location to location in search of the cheap energy that supports private accumulation. Adopting an illustrative case study of Quebec, Canada, we work to render visible the materiality of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Far from existing both nowhere and everywhere, the generation of bitcoin is foregrounded in local contexts and regional economic imaginaries with both spatial and social implications for the cities and towns where cryptomining takes place. We conclude with a call for further research into this emergent ‘crypto-regionalism’ and its consequences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Financial technology innovation within the developed world is driving financial markets, yet its adoption is lagging among consumers in emerging markets. At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings: The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in South Africa. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption. Studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Presently, votes are cast in two manners: manual mode, i.e., paper voting and the semi-manual mode using e-voting machine (EVM). Both systems require the accumulation of the voters in centralized voting booths. Several discrepancies arise due to the lack of security management in a centralized voting system. These can be avoided if a decentralized voting system can be implemented thereby providing a high-security impact. Blockchain is a technology that acts as a backbone for the highly secured parallel economy like the Bitcoin system. If this technology can be implemented as a security measure in a decentralized e-voting system, this will ensure the total security and authenticity of the voting system. In this paper, an endeavor has been made to design a blockchain-based e-voting system. Initial experimentation displayed satisfactory prospects of the system. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

I find that Bitcoin trade volume generated by underground activity reacts much more strongly to inflation expectations than Bitcoin trade volume among the general population, providing direct evidence that shadow market participants substitute away from cash and towards cryptocurrency to conduct anonymous transactions.

However, the positive impact is statistically significant only at the higher quantiles of the current CEPU. It is concluded that Bitcoin can be used in hedging against policy uncertainties in China since significant rises in uncertainty leads to a higher return in Bitcoin.

	abstract = {This study focuses on analyzing an essential issue in the Islamic Sharia. It is the Virtual/ Crypto Currencies. First, it should be noted that this term is a new one, and therefore, we cannot find any reference to virtual currencies in the old writings of Muslim scholars. Furthermore, and according to the different views of economic systems, the function of currencies is still a contradictory issue. Indeed, most economists consider the traditional functions of money as being the real ones, and Muslim scholars approve this view assuring that money is a means of exchange as well as a measure of values. Accordingly, most central banks focus on these two functions for the purpose of achieving a level of stability among prices. Similarly, interpretations of Islamic Law assure that money shall be protected from any type of waste. On the contrary, there shall be constant efforts for exploiting and increasing money. Hence, money, and as stated above, is a measure of values and not a commodity to be traded or speculated through the internet without being supervised by central banks or other authorities, which regulate the work of financial institutions. This study is constituted of three main parts. While the first part focuses on the functions and features of money as viewed by Muslim jurists, the second part deals with the types, features and functions of virtual currencies, and how they are viewed by Muslim scholars. The third and last part attempts to show the legal implications of dealing with virtual/crypto currencies, and their impact on the countries’ economies. © 2021,Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.All Rights Reserved.},

This study aper analyses how key factors underpinning the success of this ground-breaking “Internet of value” technology, such as staking of collateral (“skin in the game”), competitive crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and prediction markets, can be applied to substantially innovate the legacy organization of science, research, and technology development (RTD). Here, we elaborate a highly integrative, community-based strategy where a token-based crypto-economy supports finding best possible consensus, trust, and truth by adding unconventional elements known from reputation systems, betting, secondary markets, and social networking. These tokens support the holder’s formalized reputation and are used in liquid-democracy style governance and arbitration within projects or community-driven initiatives. This participatory research model serves as a solid basis for comprehensively leveraging collective intelligence by effectively incentivizing contributions from the crowd, such as intellectual property work, validation, assessment, infrastructure, education, assessment, governance, publication, and promotion of projects. On the analogy of its current blockbusters like peer-to-peer structured decentralized finance (“DeFi”), blockchain technology can seminally enhance the efficiency of science and RTD initiatives, even permitting to fully stage operations as a chiefless decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs).

Whether cryptocurrency has been officially recognized by the government and has been regulated in certain regulations. These questions are what we try to discuss in our study. This research is a descriptive qualitative study using primary and secondary data. Our primary data is summarized from interviews with practitioners in the cryptocurrency field and also the government regulatory body that regulates this matter. Meanwhile, we obtained secondary data from government regulations and preliminary research papers published internationally. Our research results state that cryptocurrency in Indonesia is currently still considered a commodity compared to a means of payment, even though there are government regulations regarding cryptocurrency. As a commodity, cryptocurrency has the potential to become a superior commodity like gold. However, there are also threats and challenges related to cryptocurrency, such as hacker threats and exchange rate volatility.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is heralded as being 'the next big thing' that promises to radically transform society and the economy in near-future applications. While scholarly literature on blockchain has largely focused on bitcoin and cryptofinance, in recent years, a body of scholarship has started to emerge on blockchain in the public sector. The characteristics of blockchain have made it a promising technology to transform many activities related to public policy and public service provision, such as administrative processes, welfare provision and regulation practices. This article provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic literature review of the use of blockchain across all the main public services. This systematic review identifies the public services most likely to be impacted by the introduction of blockchain. It also highlights the main potential benefits, costs and risks of blockchain for government, civil servants and citizens. Governments are found to benefit mainly from improvements in efficiency and traceability, while regulatory uncertainty and questions around scalability represent major costs and risks for them. Civil servants, the least studied actor in the literature, could benefit from blockchain through the reduction of red tape and improvements in coordination between agencies. Their lack of blockchain knowledge and skills represent a major cost as regards adoption. Regarding citizens, security and transparency are identified as being the most important benefits, while risks are mainly associated with data security concerns. The article concludes by noting several limitations in the literature and providing suggestions towards fruitful lines of research. © 2013 IEEE.},

The publication of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008 raised the prospect of global digital currencies without central issuers or intermediaries. While crypto-currencies have yet to achieve the status of money, the underlying ‘token’ technology has prompted big tech interest in stablecoins and central banks to evaluate novel forms of national currency issuance. Although crypto has captured the column inches, most real-world action in payments since 2008 has been elsewhere — the rollout of instant payments schemes, the adoption of electronic money wallets by hundreds of millions of people and the FinTech revolution.

	abstract = {This paper examines the question of what kind of money will govern the 21st century by examining the developments which characterise this landscape. On the basis of a review of the available literature and evidence, it is clear that certain technological innovations, such as the movement towards electronic money, will undoubtedly change how we operate. However, the conclusion in this paper is less sanguine regarding the prospects of a global currency, regional monetary unions, or states’ exit from or central banks’ control of money. This paper also sees poor prospects for cryptocurrencies at the moment, given their focus on the decentralisation and politicisation of money, because money requires a backstopping force, making it inherently political. Finally, this paper considers how regulators may seek to ensure that money in its digital form is not taken advantage of and applied in malevolent activities. The study used correlation to establish the level of association among variables. A multiple regression analysis was used to draw an econometric model explaining the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The following variables were used as independent variables: monetary aggregate (M1), harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), US dollar/euro, and the USD value of Bitcoin. Multiple regression predicted that when inflation rises, the money supply will decrease. M1 includes cash in circulation, current deposits, and other than demand deposits. The study concludes that price increases encourage people to keep their money in longer-term deposits, including in cryptocurrency. Additionally, an increase in EURIBOR and US dollar/euro reduces the supply of money. Otherwise, an increase in the price of bitcoin in the economy would increase the overall money supply. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The empirical findings from GARCH (1, 1) model indicates the presence of volatility clustering in the crypto market. Moreover, the results of the GJR-GARCH (1, 1) indicate the presence of leverage effects in the financial returns series of all three crypto currencies. Furthermore, the excess kurtosis confirms the existence of fat-tail phenomena in the crypto market. Overall, the findings from this study showed that in times of COVID-19 pandemic the crypto market returns series showed volatility persistence, fat-tail phenomena, and leverage effects.

	abstract = {Blockchain is a new technology slowly integrating our economy with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and many more applications. Bitcoin and other versions of it (known as Altcoins) are traded everyday at various cryptocurrency exchanges and have drawn the interest of many investors. These new types of assets are characterized by wild swings in prices, and this can lead to large swings in profit and losses. To respond to these dynamics, cryptoinvestors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of portfolio selection and optimization. Bitcoin returns have shown some form of regime change, suggesting that regime-switching models could more adequately capture the volatility dynamics. This paper presents a two-state Markov-switching COGARCH-R-vine (MSCOGARCH) model for cryptocurrency portfolio selection and compares the performance to the single-regime COGARCH-R-vine (COGARCH). The findings here are in line with the literature where MSCOGARCH outperforms the single-regime COGARCH with regard to the expected shortfall risk. The COGARCH specifications here capture the structural breaks and heavy tailness within each state of the Markov switching in order to achieve a minimal risk and a maximum return. The flexibility of R-vine copula allows adequate bivariate copula selection for each pair of cryptocurrencies to achieve suitable dependence structure through pair-copula construction architecture. © 2020, Swiss Society for Financial Market Research.},

The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Apart from the financial success of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has not yet made the leap from emerging technology to mainstream application. The introduction of blockchain tokens could now offer a major contribution to making this happen. Blockchain tokens can be representations of real-life assets or rights and are, therefore, central for connecting blockchains to real world applications. Despite their pivotal role, their mainstream adoption is still lagging behind. One reason for this is that companies struggle to develop relevant use cases. They are hampered by the rapid development of the complex technology and the lack of development processes. Existing development processes no longer apply to the new decentralized structure of token use cases. As existing research on token systems is either too technical by focusing on a very detailed description of a single use case only or too general by providing token typologies without implementation guidance, companies have no choice but trial and error. It turned out that there is a lack of structured approaches or best practices for the development of token systems. To solve this problem, we follow a design science research approach and develop a framework that guides the design of token use cases. It provides decision support for all steps of the design process and further comprises basic token types which can be used to develop standardized modules. This approach leads to a faster and cheaper development process. We build this framework based on an extensive literature review, enhance it with expert interviews and finally validate its applicability by using it to implement a decentralized parking system based on tokens. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Participants of the Bitcoin system form mining pools, which have become the leading institutions of the Bitcoin mining economy, to smooth their reward of mining. Many attacks towards mining pools have been proposed. Block Withholding attack is an attacker splitting some of the power to mine in a pool, submitting shares while withholding blocks, which is one of the most famous and original attacks. Few pieces of research pay attention to the case that managers work rationally to gain extra rewards themselves at the same time of countering withholding attack. However, some different reward functions have been proposed to avoid rational miners' withholding. In this paper, we offer a model that a rational manager gain extra rewards and incentivize miners not to withhold blocks by applying a dynamic mining strategy. We conduct quantitive analysis and simulations to verify the availability and effectiveness of our attacks. We show the attack benefits the miners in the pool in some circumstances, and further discuss improvement for our attack.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {With the ever-growing popularity of cryptocurrency in India as well as globally, it is potential as an agent of various illegal activities such as money laundering and cybersecurity breaches is also gaining traction in the global, national and regional debates. Considering its emergence in India, it is pertinent to examine the issues associated with the usage of cryptocurrency and the scope it entails for the Indian economy if allowed. The government of India has so far not identified it as valid tender due to its potential usage in hiding black money and in terror financing. However, the government has not necessarily closed the door to any future regulations of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, despite operating in a grey area, the sector continues to proliferate in India and the world. This paper briefly describes the nuances and current affairs related to cryptocurrencies across the globe. It further provides a legal and regulatory perspective of cryptocurrencies in India while also discusses various cybersecurity issues related to its usage and concludes with a list of challenges associated with its incorporation in the national legal regime and tries to provide a certain recommendation that can help guide the future regulation of this disruptive innovation. © 2021, Transition Academia Press.

	abstract = {The terms decentralized organization and distributed organization are often used interchangeably, despite describing two distinct phenomena. I propose distinguishing decentralization, as the dispersion of organizational communications, from distribution, as the dispersion of organizational decision-making. Organizations can be distributed without being decentralized (and vice versa), and having multiple management layers directly affects only distribution – not decentralization. This proposed distinction has implications for understanding the growth of digital platforms (e.g. amazon.com), which dominate the global economy in the 21st century. While prominent platforms typically use machine learning as their core technology to transform inputs (e.g. data) into outputs (e.g. matchmaking services), blockchain has emerged as an alternative technological blueprint. I argue that blockchain enables platforms that are both decentralized and distributed (e.g. Bitcoin), whereas machine learning fosters centralized communications and the concentration of decision-making (e.g. Facebook Inc.). This distinction has crucial implications for antitrust policy, which, I contend, should shift both its analysis and its target of action away from the corporate level and focus instead on the data level. Based on this essay’s framework, I make several predictions regarding the future of competition between centralized and decentralized platforms, the evolution of government regulation, and broader implications for managers in the digital economy and for the business schools charged with their education. I conclude with reflections on the opportunity to revive cybernetic thinking for preventing a dystopian future dominated by a handful of platform behemoths. © The Author(s) 2020.},

The world's economy and financial institutions are digitizing at an unprecedented rate. Bitcoin is a devolved crypto-currency, or digital asset, that uses blockchain technology to expedite peer-to-peer financial transactions. Price volatility is one of the primary issues with decentralized cryptocurrencies, highlighting the need of examining the underlying price mechanism. Additionally, Bitcoin prices display non-stationary behaviour, meaning that their statistical distribution fluctuates over time. Bitcoin prices are stochastic, and no one set of characteristics can be used to forecast them completely. Nonetheless, academics have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness in estimating Bitcoin values using various feature sets. This article explains how to forecast Bitcoin price movements and prices using machine learning approaches. We intend to apply ARIMA, Facebook Prophet and XGBoost techniques for price prediction.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Blockchain, which was originally created to enable peer-to-peer digital payment systems (bitcoin), is considered to have several benefits for different sectors, such as the real estate one. In a standard European-wide real estate transaction, several intermediaries are involved. As a consequence, these agreements are usually time-consuming and involve extra difficulties to cross-border operations. As blockchain, combined with smart contracts, may have an important role in these transactions, this paper aims to explore its prospective challenges, limitations and opportunities in the real estate sector and discover how the traditional intermediaries have to face a possible implementation of this technology. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses the current intermediaries in the real estate sector in European Union (EU), their functions and how can blockchain strengthen the security of these transactions while reducing their time. The author uses a legal methodology to approach it. Findings: Blockchain, combined with smart contracts, has both challenges and opportunities for the real estate sector. On the one hand, it may improve procedures, allow EU transactions and the interconnection between public administration. However, to not reduce parties rights, this blockchain should have some special features, such as the possibility of being amended. Originality/value: This paper provides a valuable overview of all the intermediaries that could be affected by blockchain protocols. It is of interest of blockchain developers, public administrations and researchers who are working on blockchain and property conveyancing. © 2020, Rosa M. Garcia-Teruel.},

This paper intends to estimate the usability of blockchain technology by investigating behavioral elements that affect customers' intention towards blockchain-based cryptocurrency transactions. Given the complexity of the technology, this study proposes a new integration model: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) together with new external variables regarding blockchain adoption characteristics such as trust, regulatory support, social influence, design, and experience. Surveys were conducted among international users to identify the impacts of these variables on their intention. Our findings indicate two powerful constructs (regulatory support and experience) that encourage customer trust towards blockchain-based applications. People surveyed agreed on a great sense of security and can trust the Blockchain-based applications when they are regulated and insured by the local government. Also, at a certain level of experience, users feel confident to use blockchain-based applications, a high level of trust supports technology adoption. As such, governments and businesses can dedicate efforts to enhance customers' trust and ultimately promote better acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications. © 2020},

	abstract = {This paper conducts a review on theoretical and empirical findings on the increasingly popular measure of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) in economics and finance. Moreover, an empirical investigation takes place in order to find the impact that TPU exerts on Bitcoin market values by employing a spectrum of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) specifications. Existing studies support that trade policy uncertainty leads to lower-quality and more expensive products and weak participation in international trade. Moreover, it contributes to lower democratic sentiment, hesitant internal migration and lesser socio-economic mobility and higher fluctuations in profitable assets. Moreover, our econometric findings reveal that TPU positively affects Bitcoin prices while crude oil values negatively influence this major cryptocurrency. Thereby, higher trade policy uncertainty is found to increase demand and favorite investments into risky assets in order to ameliorate the risk-return trade-off in investors’ portfolios. This study provides a compass for investing during turmoil due to trade wars and tariffs. © 2021 by the author.},

The Bitcoin and Ethereum markets are studied due to the level of electricity demand for active trading and mining in the three leading crypto mining economies (United States, China, and Japan). Among other findings, the leading net transmitter of information is the return of the Bitcoin market while the demand for electricity in the U.S. and Japan are the leading net information receivers in the ECN system. In a nutshell, the return and trading volumes of the cryptocurrency markets are net information transmitters while the markets' volatility and the demand for electricity in the U.S., China, and Japan are net information receivers in the system. As a policy relevance, given the favourable developments in these crypto markets, greener sources of electrical energy are expedient to mitigate emissions while mining these coins.

	abstract = {The amount of data is increasing very fast annually due to the rapid changes in modern technology. The data becomes very huge in each organization which led to the emergence of the new concept called Big Data. Big Data creates a valuable chance for companies to maximize their outcomes by analyzing this type of data. However, there is a concern regarding user privacy in the centralized systems as they have limited control over their personal stored information and how to use it. Added to that is the need for third-party availability which is considered another security issue. Recently, new accountable systems have emerged called Bitcoin. The world started using blockchain technology by deploying the first application namely bitcoin. It is a digital currency used for trading things over the web like money in the real world. Due to the success of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has gained trust from users as it is used in various fields and services, for example, monetary institutions, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain, election, medicinal handling, and stockpiling. The main idea of the blockchain is to establish distributed agreement in the digital online world. It opens a great opportunity for the digital economy to be more scalable than the current centralized one. There are huge wonderful features and chances upcoming with this novel technology, and the uprising in this area has just commenced. Due to the importance of this technology, this paper aims to assess the current status of implementing blockchain technology in Oman. The statistical results clearly show the weak implementation of this technology in Oman's sectors. © 2021 University of Bahrain. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the development of the digital economy, the price of Bitcoin, which is the most representative digital currency, has fluctuated dramatically. Recent works have explored the volatility of the Bitcoin price and made predictions using financial time series models such as ARIMA. However, for high-frequency Bitcoin data, the financial time series models have poor prediction performance as they often do not accommodate the inherent characteristics of digital currency, such as blockchain information. Some other works in this topic use deep learning models, e.g., artificial neural networks. However, the complex structure and time-consuming training process of these deep learning models often incur low prediction efficiency for rapidly changing Bitcoin price. In this regard, Broad Learning System (BLS) is a new neural network that avoids the complex structure of hidden nodes in deep learning models by adding enhancement nodes in the input layer to improve training efficiency while delivering relatively high accuracy. Therefore, this work applies the broad learning system to predict the Bitcoin price and optimizes the prediction model with a genetic algorithm. Due to the lack of fundamental factors for digital currency, the proposed prediction model considers the macroeconomic variables and the information of Bitcoin blockchain, which is the underlying technology of bitcoin, as inputs. According to the experimental results, the BLS-based prediction model optimized with the genetic algorithm achieved a better performance than other machine learning models. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study measures the evolution of the anonymous marketplaces Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution, Nucleus, Abraxas, and AlphaBay, which were the seven leading and most active dark web marketplaces. We identify that all the seven marketplaces use the same software to manage Bitcoin by investigating transactions in these marketplaces. However, the software was no longer used since May 2016 because of its vulnerability to protect anonymity. It indicates that dark web marketplaces advanced to the next stage with anonymity-enhancing tools around in March 2016. Using simple heuristics to identify and trace Bitcoin addresses associated with these marketplaces, purchases on these marketplaces are identified and evaluated. Our method provides evidence on market size, development, and fluctuation over time to fill a gap in previous studies. Dark web marketplaces continue to thrive because users migrate to new marketplaces after the existing ones are shut down. The total sales volume on Silk Road was 192.7 million US dollars between June 2012 and October 2013. The corresponding figures for Silk Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution, Nucleus, and Abraxas were 112.9, 220.7, 69.7, 88.3, and 35.6 million US dollars, respectively. The figures for AlphaBay was 166.0 million US dollars between December 2014 and February 2016. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This exploratory and explanatory research has been performed in the context of digitization of Bangladesh economy. The research question is whether the transformation of Bangladesh towards the digital economy can act effectively and efficiently for the benefits of the society and the economy. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted. Sixteen hypotheses were tested based on the Chi-square test. The time period of the study was from April 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. The Chi-square test findings were significant for the following null hypotheses: Internet of Thinking will not bring benefits of the human beings; robots are not needed for industries; big data cannot be used for the business intelligence; artificial intelligence (AI) is not effective; bitcoin transactions should not be allowed; the banking sector is not relatively digitalized; chatbots do not need to be used in banks; drones cannot be used for commercial purpose; robots cannot be used for education purpose; farmers must not learn to yield wirelessly. Another six null hypotheses were rejected. Fear of losing employment was the key obstruction to execute the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) in the country as revealed from the study. Proper information and communication technology (ICT) based education, preparation and knowledge were required. Good governance and regulation should be established with the help of digitization in Bangladesh. The study is suggested to answer the research question, if the benefit from transforming the society to the digital economy may outweigh negative impacts and turn threats into opportunities, reduce demand for labor and disguised unemployment and narrow down the scope of creating new employment opportunities in the country. The potential unlocking system in the global market is feasible through ensuring digitization of Bangladesh society. © 2020 The Author.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to provide insights as to why money laundering persists in banks and their weaknesses as gatekeepers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper contextualizes the design and proliferation of anti-money laundering (AML) measures; investigates the different manners of conceptualizing them; and provides insights pertaining to probable limitations of these measures. The paper relies on primary data from statutes and secondary data from published sources. Findings: The paper’s findings suggest that competitive pressures, shareholders return imperative, and lucrative misaligned incentives for management contributed to weaknesses in effective compliance in banks. Practical implications: Insights drawn from this paper reinforces the notion that banks need to seriously review their business approaches, as well as their roles as gatekeepers. Social implications: Given the slew of corporate scandals and other materially harmful misjudgments in money-laundering compliance, banks might need to seriously review their role and obligations in the economy. Originality/value: Much has been said about money-laundering activities enabled by the banking sector. This paper contributed to insights as to why they persist despite AML rules, and what measures could be further taken to enhance compliance effectiveness. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We have conducted an online study of eleven marketplaces residing within the darknet, addressing what kind of cyber attack items are available and where the profit lies. The results have been used to create a detailed categorization of items, showing a distribution based on item type and availability. This has been compared to the number of sold items and revenue from four of the marketplaces, and we discuss these different views. Aided by related studies, we have identified trending cyber threats such as phone hacking, information theft and bitcoin stealing. © 2019 IEEE.},

Inside two years of its tranquil dispatch in 2009, Bitcoin developed to involve billions of US dollars of financial incentive regardless of just careless examination of the framework's plan. In the meantime an enormous and lively open-source network has proposed and sent various adjustments and augmentations. However, the GCC region remains unexplored in terms of cryptocurrency research. Hence, we provide the first survey on cryptocurrency in the GCC economy. In this exploratory study, we used an online questionnaire survey that was collected from 610 individuals and investors from all Gulf countries namely: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and UAE. The research instrument consists of 24 different questions that measure respondents’ opinions and attitudes toward cryptocurrency in the GCC. The findings reveal that most respondents in the GCC have heard or read about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, a vast majority of them (85%) do not own cryptocurrency. In addition, investing in cryptocurrency is more risky and less profitable than investing in the stock market. Also, if cryptocurrency is government regulated but remained intangible, it would increase their interest in cryptocurrency, and in near future i.e. within 5 years, cryptocurrency will be worth more than today. © 2020 IJSTR.},

	abstract = {Market forces are not the only influence on currency exchange rates. They can change due to monetary and fiscal policies among other international repercussions. Bitcoin, for its independence from all the central banks worldwide, has a natural shield that will change the direction in the economic policy of the industrialized countries. The research aim is to analyze the influence that indicators and financial assets can have on Bitcoin. The study tries to confirm the reasons why it has begun to be the solution in economies with unstable currencies. The behavior of the different agents appears as the core of the study. It is creating a backward 5-year work horizon. The data are continuous values, and they are the numerical variables for Pearson correlation analysis. The time series in fixed periods are the basis for the study of projections. Besides, the Relative Strength Index or Relative Strength Index called Welles Wilder is useful in the research. Bitcoin does not get influenced by the Dow Jones, gold price, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The independence in the creation of this cryptocurrency could in the long term end up turning it into a currency of world use. As a result, the understanding and management of this cryptocurrency could generate new ways of building the future monetary system. The new direction of the economy will be registered in the blockchain and not in a central bank. © Angel Enrique Chico Frias, Edwin Javier Santamaría Freire, 2019},

Although it now seems to be an impossible and hard-to-accept scenario, especially by the big players in the industry, the pilot projects so far demonstrate that blockchain can play a major role in the future energy market, even if the technology is still in the first stages of the adoption life cycle. This article attempts to describe a solution to provide alternative irrigation systems for small farmers. The solution involves creating associations of small farmers that will use green energy from photovoltaic panels for the irrigation of agricultural lands. The efficiency of the proposed system can be monitored not only through digital hardware connected to photovoltaic panels and water pumps, but also by using the new blockchain technology that stimulates innovation and growth in the energy and a high level of automation though smart contracts. To accelerate the transition to the green energy economy, a SolarCoin version similar to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has also been proposed, which is a utility token that creates new possibilities for energy and water trading. © 2020 by the authors.},

This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It introduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to several other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a non-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The analysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly correlated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a marginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the interactions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a causality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures and shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across currencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of significative interactions. Overall this study uncovers a complex and rich structure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other both instantaneously and with lead–lag causal relations. A major finding is that minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in shaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level of noise and the short time-series I verified that these networks are significant with all links statistically validated and with a structural organisation consistently reproduced across all networks. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Announced in June 2019, Facebook’s Libra initiative represents a culmination of these novel approaches. This paper will review the current alternatives for international payments and the drivers behind these developments. The paper adopts a taxonomy to characterise money in the digital age and extends this in order to compare the different solutions. Three main dimensions can be applied to distinguish the concepts: tokens versus accounts; proprietary/closed-loop versus interopera-ble; and settlement-based versus messages between local pools. While no current alternative could completely replace the existing system for the time being, close monitoring of the way forward and more research will be needed to derive more insight into this complex challenge. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.},

	abstract = {Given a fixed product system model, with the current computational framework of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the potential environmental impacts associated to demanding one thousand units of a product will be one thousand times larger than what results from demanding 1 unit only – a linear relationship. However, due to economies of scale, industrial synergies, efficiency gains, and system design, activities at different scales will perform differently in terms of life cycle impact – in a non-linear way. This study addresses the issue of using the linear framework of LCA to study scalable and emerging technologies, by looking at different examples where technology scale up reflects non-linearly on the impact of a product. First, a computer simulation applied to an entire database is used to quantitatively estimate the effect of assuming activities in a product system are subject to improvements in efficiency. This provides a theoretical but indicative idea of how much uncertainty can be introduced by non-linear relationships between input values and results at the database level. Then the non-linear relations between the environmental burden per tkm of transport on one end, and the cargo mass and range autonomy on the other end is highlighted using a parametrized LCA model for heavy goods vehicles combined with learning scenarios that reflect different load factors and improvement in battery technology. Finally, a last example explores the case of activities related to the mining of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, an emerging technology, and how the impact of scaling the Bitcoin mining production is affected non-linearly by factors such as increase in mining efficiency and geographical distribution of miners. The paper concludes by discussing the relation between non-linearity and uncertainty and by providing recommendations for accounting for non-linearity in prospective LCA studies.

Analysing the growing scientific literature on bitcoin published between 2012 and 2019, we provided useful insights on academic research in this field regarding publication year, type and category, authors, journals and citations. The source of the 887 documents which support the study was Web of Science Core Collection. Using VOSviewer software we have designed bibliometric maps based on text and bibliographic data. Our study provides a knowledge area map that identifies and evaluates the links between authors and countries distribution, the conceptual structure of the field, the structure and connections of most cited papers and journals. Resuming our findings, we note a concentration of the interest on some keywords (bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain) and on some influential authors (with more than 100 citations per article).

	abstract = {With the rapid development of social economy, the number of Android mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years. At present, digital forensics experts mainly extract digital evidence from non-volatile physical memory and file system of mobile devices. However, non-volatile storage based method has little effect for some high secure Apps forensics, such as the encrypted data or deleted information, e.g. the private conversation records or payment records, in chat Apps or payment Apps. Accordingly, data residential in memory is an important source of evidence. On the other hand, relying solely on digital evidence in non-volatile storage is incomplete and unreliable as well. So, the demand for memory forensic on the Android platform has increased. In this paper, based on ptrace a scheme for Android memory extraction at the process level is proposed. For this scheme, a complete memory mirror of a specific process can be achieved, including memory space shared anonymously by the process and other processes, the memory space of the process, and the memory space of each thread in process. This method is of great importance to high secure Apps forensics, such as Chat Apps or Bitcoin Payment Apps. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Number of business fields and government processes across the world are depending on Blockchain platforms for their unique characteristics of decentralization, distributed and public digital ledger. Blockchain has the potentials in providing security for transactions between several inventive commercial trading, government, healthcare, payments, and other critical applications, however they still have to deal with a security weakness on their fresh important infringement of exchanges. Thus the major security issues left behind are needed to be control before blockchain acquire the mainstream. At present days, this technology counts on hardware security modules (HSM) for the protection and management of their digital keys as it generates key pairs, providing secure storage removing cryptographic operations from the complete system. On the other hand, considering the flexibility, economy and reprogrammable or reconfigurable hardware design, FPGAs are being proposed for various hardware realizations of algorithms. The paper is on the advancement of blockchain technology enhancing the scalability and reliability of the HSM by employing it with FPGA. Bringing in the idea of PUF into the chip along with the Blockchain technology to secure and store its encryption or private keys, its security level can be enhanced. The paper also tells about the involvement of FPGAs in mining and FPGA implementation of SHA-256 algorithm to secure the data inside the blocks cryptographically. © 2019 SERSC.},

It has realized peer-to-peer digital data transfer without the trust of third parties. On the other hand, activity-based micro-pricing alters user behavior through economic incentives. By combining these technologies, we develop a blockchain that runs on a new consensus algorithm, proof-of-contribution. This consensus algorithm alters the behaviors of the members in a community by distributing rewards for generating blocks as monetary incentives. We first introduce the system of “community cash,” and then discuss future works that can be implemented in the proposed infrastructure as well as remaining problems to be solved. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Not only does it revolutionize the way it is paid, but it also potentially affects the USD as the USD, which is already a challenge for the challenges of the EURO or the Chinese Renminbi Yuan (CNY). The increase in crypto currencies will give a new dimension to this challenge for the Ringgit (MYR) in Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to understand the many factors that are gaining momentum in Bitcoin (BTC) in several areas of global finance and how confusing it can be, including the financial system of the major fiduciary currencies, which is mainly MYRs.

	abstract = {The aim of the article is to verify whether bitcoin can act as a hedge, diversifier or safe haven on various stock markets, depending on the economic situation in the countries. To diversify the sample, we include five very different countries in our study: Japan, Venezuela, China, Estonia, and Sweden. Using daily data over the period 2014–2017, we estimate the dynamic conditional correlation model between main stock indices and bitcoin price in local currencies (Bitflyer — in the case of the yen, Kraken — in the case of the euro, Huobi in the case of yuan and LocalBitcoins in all the remaining cases), as well as between main stock indices and the bitcoin price in the US dollar (Bitfinex exchange). We apply the Stochastic Volatility Model with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation. We add binary variables into the dynamic correlation equation, indicating the occurrence of extreme return on the stock-exchange index in the lower 1%, 5% and 10% quantile. The conclusions vary, depending whether we consider trade on the local bitcoin exchanges or in the global one. We conclude that bitcoin was treated as a safe haven asset only in the case of Venezuela and investments in bolivars. In the case of local investments in Japan and China bitcoin behaved as a diversifier. In the bitcoin-friendly economies of Sweden and Estonia it acted as a weak hedge. In the case of the USD trade, the results suggest that bitcoin is a weak hedge with respect to all of the analyzed markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereum's Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paper-based current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereum's Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed application may eventually expand in to other municipalities, including major urban centers and private condominiums. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, because of its novelty and complexity, mental models of blockchain technology are difficult to acquire. Building on embodied cognition theories and material centered-design, we report an innovative approach for the design of BlocKit, a physical three-dimensional kit for materializing blockchain infrastructure and its key entities. Through an engagement with different materials such as clay, paper, or transparent containers we identified important properties of these entities and materialized them through physical artifacts. BlocKit was evaluated by 15 experienced bitcoin users with findings indicating its value for their high level of engagement in communicating about, and designing for blockchain infrastructure. Our study advances an innovative approach for the design of such kits, an initial vocabulary to talk about them, and design implications intended to inspire HCI researchers to engage in designing for infrastructures. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The availability of the entire Bitcoin transaction history, stored in its public blockchain, offers interesting opportunities for analysing the transaction graph to obtain insight on users behaviour. This paper presents an analysis of the Bitcoin users graph, obtained by clustering the transaction graph, to highlight its connectivity structure and the economical meaning of the different obtained components. In fact, the bow tie structure, already observed for the graph of the web, is augmented, in the Bitocoin users graph, with the economical information about the entities involved. We study the connectivity components of the users graph individually, to infer their macroscopic contribution to the whole economy. We define and evaluate a set of measures of nodes inside each component to characterize and quantify such a contribution. We also perform a temporal analysis of the evolution of the resulting bow tie structure. Our findings confirm our hypothesis on the components semantic, defined in terms of their economical role in the flow of value inside the graph. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Given that there are both continuous and discontinuous components in the movement of asset prices, existing asset pricing models that assume only continuous price movements should be revised. In this paper, we explore the features of jumps, which are discontinuous movements, by examining Bitcoin pricing. First, we identify jumps in the Bitcoin price on a daily basis, applying a non-parametric methodology and then break down the Bitcoin total rate of return into a jump rate of return and a continuous rate of return. In our empirical analysis, price jumps turn out to be independent of volatility. Moreover, the jumps in the Bitcoin price do not appear at regular intervals; rather, they tend to be concentrated in clusters during special periods, implying that once an economic crisis occurs, the crisis will last for a long time due to contagion effects and the economy will take a considerable amount of time to recover fully. Further, the contribution of the jump rate of return to the total rate of return of the Bitcoin price is lower than the contribution of the continuous return, implying that the pursuit of sustainable returns rather than large but temporary returns will improve the total rate of return over the long term. Finally, more jumps are observed when trading volume is lower, implying that market illiquidity drives discontinuous movement in asset prices. Overall, the features of jump risk are like two sides of the same coin and jump risks are expected to have a significant effect on asset pricing, suggesting that consideration of jumps is essential for risk management as well as asset pricing. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Crypto-currencies, decentralized electronic currencies systems, denote a radical change in financial exchange and economy environment. Consequently, it would be attractive for designers and policy-makers in this area to make out what social media users think about them on Twitter. The purpose of this study is to investigate the social opinions about different kinds of crypto-currencies and tune the best-customized classification technique to categorize the tweets based on sentiments. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilized a lexicon-based approach for analyzing the reviews on a wide range of crypto-currencies over Twitter data to measure positive, negative or neutral sentiments; in addition, the end result of sentiments played a training role to train a supervised technique, which can predict the sentiment loading of tweets about the main crypto-currencies. Findings: The findings further prove that more than 50 per cent of people have positive beliefs about crypto-currencies. Furthermore, this paper confirms that marketers can predict the sentiment of tweets about these crypto-currencies with high accuracy if they use appropriate classification techniques like support vector machine (SVM). Practical implications: Considering the growing interest in crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, Litcoin and Ripple), the findings of this paper have a remarkable value for enterprises in the financial area to obtain the promised benefits of social media analysis at work. In addition, this paper helps crypto-currencies vendors analyze public opinion in social media platforms. In this sense, the current paper strengthens our understanding of what happens in social media for crypto-currencies. Originality/value: For managers and decision-makers, this paper suggests that the news and campaign for their crypto in Twitter would affect people’s perspectives in a good manner. Because of this fact, the firms, investing in these crypto-currencies, could apply the social media as a magnifier for their promotional activities. The findings steer the market managers to see social media as a predictor tool, which can analyze the market through understanding the opinions of users of Twitter. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the transparency and traceability of blockchain severely restrict the anonymity of participants in the real world, which will cause participants' privacy leakage. Toward this end, in this paper, an anonymous off-blockchain micropayments scheme (AOM) is proposed for cryptocurrencies in the real world. In AOM, a payee receives micropayments from an 'honest-but-curious' intermediary {\mathcal {T}} by solving puzzles which are generated based on the standard RSA assumption. Meanwhile, {\mathcal {T}} also receives micropayments from the payers by payee's solutions and {\mathcal {T}} will randomly select the inputs of the merging transaction {T}_{\text {mer}}. In order to improve service efficiency of {\mathcal {T}} and resist denial of service attack, one of the outputs of {T}_{\text {mer}} is paid for {\mathcal {T}} as a service fee. Besides, AOM simultaneously ensures the correctness and fairness of transactions. Finally, from the analyses of property and security, AOM has strong unlinkability, ability for anti-attacks and unforgeability. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Despite the existing advances on research and education in cybersecurity and its applications, the field is still under discovery and new technologies are evolving. In recent years, Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency cyber application that records all financial transactions present on a blockchain where users can reach a secure and robust consensus on transactions emerges as the most popular peer-to-peer electronic payment system. Cryptocurrencies mostly rely on blockchain, as a secure decentralised append-only ledger to exchange digital currencies, and thereby attracting a billion-dollar economy. Bitcoin allows input transactions to link addresses and this can be used by an adversary to reveal real user identity. This obviously attracts privacy issues such as user's information and identity leakage. Several existing techniques are found not satisfactory to fulfil practical and compatible anonymity requirements for users and their transaction. We present in this paper, a secure privacy-preservation scheme based on bilinear pairing and other cryptographic primitives. We proved that our proposed scheme is robust and can be implemented to preserve users and transaction privacy in the Bitcoin system by theoretical analysis and evaluation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this essay, I argue that cryptocurrencies and blockchains are important objects of general social science research and thought, but not for their ‘moneyness’ per se. Through a historical sociology of the antecedents and discourse leading up to Bitcoin, I show that it was never meant to be ‘money’ in the economic sense, but rather a solution to a technical puzzle for preventing opportunistic actors from double-spending digital ‘coins,’ as well as a fervent ideology surrounding online privacy and infringement of individual rights in the digital age. Drawing from themes in science and technology studies, I suggest that Bitcoin and other ‘cryptoassets’ are properly socio-technological assemblages that constitute new and important objects of social inquiry that must be understood beyond the myopic context of crypto-money. I conclude by proposing three alternative ontologies for blockchains relevant to economic, political, and social life: as systems of accounting, as organizational forms, and as institutions in their own right. © The Author(s) 2019.},

We propose a new definition of a weak and strong safe-haven within a bivariate cross-quantilogram approach. This definition considers the lowest tails of both the safe-haven asset and the stock index. Our sample period spans from 19 July 2010 until 22 February 2018 and focuses on several stock market indices, including those of the US, China, and other developed and emerging economies. Our main results show that, at best, each of Bitcoin, gold, and the commodity index can be considered as a weak safe-haven asset in some cases. Rolling-window predictability analyses generally confirm those results and reveal that the safe-haven roles of Bitcoin, gold, and commodities are time-varying and differ across the stock market indices under study. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to use a new notion called “Consensus Game (CG)” with motivation from the mechanism design of blockchain economy under the consensus incentives from Bitcoin ecosystems in financial technology (Fintech) to study the existence of equilibria for the data trading under the framework of Internet of Things (IoT). By a fact that for a given sets of sensors, sensors may take action in cooperative, or noncooperative strategies (games), we formulate s model (called “Consensus Game of IoT”) to analyze this competitive situation among the sensors with the mixture of cooperative and noncooperative strategy (game). Then we provide the analytical condition for the existence of the consensus games of IoT in general. The application shows that the concept of consensus games of IoT may play a key role for the study of data trading under the framework of IoT associated with Blockchain ecosystems. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain is a shared distributed digital ledger technology that can better facilitate data management, provenance and security, and has the potential to transform healthcare. Importantly, blockchain represents a data architecture, whose application goes far beyond Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain and has popularized the technology. In the health sector, blockchain is being aggressively explored by various stakeholders to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient outcomes, enhance compliance, and enable better use of healthcare-related data. However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as 'revolutionary' and 'disruptive', is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is 'fit-for-purpose' is pivotal. This concept forms the basis for this article, where we share views from a multidisciplinary group of practitioners at the forefront of blockchain conceptualization, development, and deployment. © 2019 The Author(s).},

However, most of these currencies have a very general purpose, namely of allowing people to pay their products with an electronic, decentralised currency. Moreover, the lack of trust of these open-network blockchains comes at a significant economic cost. In this paper, we present PlasticCoin, a cryptocurrency empowering plastic reuse in a circular economical model, that anyone can join, and that respects the ERC20 specifications on a consortium blockchain. We also explore the economical ecosystem revolving around PlasticCoin, and also introduce a way to print tickets that can temporarily hold the role of physical banknotes. Finally, we show that our system is flexible, and it can be adapted to many other business purposes. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Blockchain is a fast-disruptive technology becoming a key instrument in share economy. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract aim to automatically and securely execute the needed responsibilities of a contract without the support of a centralized execution authority. The Smart Contract runs on top of the Blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between un-trusted parties without the interfere of third party to trust it as this Smart Contract is an executable code that runs with rules on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts have some features that serve the goals of social justice and fairness. The paper presents the basic important information about the structures of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and conduct a comparison between the different methodologies used in the Smart Contracts. The issues faced within the Smart Contract technology are surveyed. The four key issues are identified as: codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. We survey case cases of usage of the Blockchain in various business sectors like real estate, voting system and supply chain. The paper aims to assist a developer to grasp the big picture of the Blockchain technology and to further assist in the decision process of suitability of the technology to a specific application area. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

However, globally there are economies which favour the bitcoin and some have banned the same. While many day traders have cash out their funds, veteran traders remain unfazed. In this scenario, it is essential to look into their price behaviour which reveals that there is huge a fluctuation, i.e., highly volatile in nature. Henceforth, their relationships with the trading volume, money supply, lag prices which influences the trade in bitcoin are measured using the ANN model revealing highly significant relationship.  © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The problems of countering the financing of terrorism are relevant in the context of the fight against crime for Russia and for the whole world. The financing of terrorism has long roots, but now the methods of financing are largely developed through the global Internet and the development of digital economy technologies. The continuous improvement of the Internet’s capabilities not only opens up additional prospects for the development of the world community, but is also accompanied by the emergence of a number of new global threats. Traditional forms of financing terrorism are transformed using modern digital technologies - cryptocurrency and virtual currencies, crowdfunding, fundraising, social networks and Telegram channels are actively used by terrorist organizations. In a digital economy, terrorist acts can have an impact on government operations and finances, the cost of securities and the investment climate, significantly reduce tax revenues, help increase the share of military spending in the state budget, and have a devastating effect on the state and society as a whole. The development of effective solutions to the problem of countering the financing of terrorism is one of the priority areas of scientific research. The article presents the results of an assessment of the main existing methods of financing terrorist activities and elaborated proposals for countering their proliferation and reducing the risks of activating new modern sources of enrichment of criminal communities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

This cash mostly stay in people's pockets and travels back to people's home country. There are ways that LFC can be brought back into the economy such as souvenir shopping at the airports, donations to a charity wending machine or throwing into fountains to wish. However, these means of utilization have various limitations associated with them. Hence, there is a need for a transparent and a more convenient method to spend the LFC. In this work, we implement a system that solves the LFC problem by converting it into a cryptocurrency. The process of conversion requires depositing the LFC at a kiosk. The users can then use an android application to receive the cryptocurrency which they deposit in the foreign country. The amount of cryptocurrency bought by current rate appears in the users' e-wallet. The kiosk backend handles the currency and storage of critical transactions in a blockchain. The proposed system gives a fairly simple solution for a long lasting problem that is only possible because of the blockchain technology. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies are a novel and disruptive technology that has prompted a new approach to how currencies work in the modern economy. As such, online discussions related to cryptocurrencies often go beyond posts about the technology and underlying architecture of the various coins, to subjective speculations of price fluctuations and predictions. Furthermore, online discussions, potentially driven by foreign adversaries, criminals or hackers, can have a significant impact on our economy and national security if spread at scale. This paper is the first to qualitatively measure and contrast discussion growth about three popular cryptocurrencies with key distinctions in motivation, usage, and implementation - Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero on Reddit. More specifically, we measure how discussions relevant to these coins spread in online social environments - how deep and how wide they go, how long they last, how many people they reach, etc. More importantly, we compare user behavior patterns between the focused community of the official coin subreddits and the general community across Reddit as a whole. Our Reddit sample covers three years of data between 2015 and 2018 and includes a time period of a record high Bitcoin price rise.1 Our results demonstrate that while the largest discussions on Reddit are focused on Bitcoin, posts about Monero (a cryptocurrency often used by criminals for illegal transactions on the Dark Web2) start discussions that are typically longer and wider. Bitcoin posts trigger subsequent discussion more immediately but Monero posts are more likely to trigger a longer lasting discussion. We find that moderately subjective posts across all three coins trigger larger, longer, and more viral discussion cascades within both focused and general communities on Reddit. Our analysis aims to bring the awareness to online discussion spread relevant to cryptocurrencies in addition to informing models for forecasting cryptocurrency price that rely on discussions in social media. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.},

Dark Data is the data that an organisation collects and then fails to harness its value which then adds to the biggest portion of Big Data. This paper unlocks the potential of the upcoming revolution in digital economy, especially in the field of global financial markets: The Blockchain Technology. It is the engine behind the most popular, the very first cryptocurrency called the Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. We have explored various reasons for this technology to be a disruptive force in future, its current trends, various advantages and limitations. Also intersection of Blockchain Technology, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence when used to handle Dark Data (unstructured or unused data) will not only upgrade the value of data, but will provide us with more transparent and efficient results, since Blockchain is nothing but a secure database of online transactions in itself. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {There is a growing expectation, or at least a hope, that blockchains possess a disruptive potential in numerous domains because of their decentralized nature (i.e., no single entity controls their operations). Decentralization comes with a price, however: blockchains do not scale-they are incapable of processing a large, or even moderate, number of transactions in a timely manner. For example, bitcoin processes three transactions per second. The root of the problem-and the limiting factor for blockchains-is a trustless peer-to-peer network model, in which information must be suboptimally propagated to- and validated at-every hop in the network. Undoubtedly, cloud-delivery networks (e.g., Akamai or YouTube), which resolved similar performance challenges in other domains (e.g., web and video delivery), could help scale blockchains as well. The problem is that such large centralized infrastructures disturb the decentralized nature of blockchains, hence eliminating their disruptive potential. The question is, can cloud-delivery networks be used to scale blockchains without upsetting their decentralized nature? The answer is positive, and the key to the solution lies in an advanced version of an existing concept: net neutrality. Blockchain and the cryptocurrency revolution initiated by bitcoin in 20088 are thriving.The market capitalization of prominent cryptocurrencies, while highly volatile, continues to be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. A unique feature of blockchains is the lack of centralized administration. They rely on third-party mediation, (i.e., a global peer-to-peer network of participants who validate and certify all transactions). Given the purely distributed and decentralized design of blockchains, many people believe that such systems have a disruptive potential in other areas beyond cryptocurrencies, including health care, government, manufacturing, retail, insurance, The Internet of things, the sharing economy, etc. Numerous high-tech companies, big and small, are closely watching the blockchain space, analyzing how the new technology could affect their existing or future operations. A major problem for blockchains is scalability. The blockchain system throughput is measured in the number of TPS (transactions per second) a system can support. Bitcoin's current average throughput of three TPS compares to 2,000 TPS average throughput in Visa's centralized system, 4,000 TPS daily peak, and 56,000 TPS maximum capacity. Without scalability, cryptocurrency systems will hardly become mainstream, and blockchains are unlikely to realize their disruptive potential in any other areas.

	abstract = {Supply chain management is considered as one of the key elements to leveraging a company's success. Active global crypto currency market growth "overwhelming" national economic systems contributes to the formation of a new type of economic relations which makes supply chain as the crucial factor in development. Despite the fact that at the current time in the world community a single (unified) approach to the legal regulation of the crypto currency market has not yet been developed, crypto currency is considered by many world regulators as a promising tool in the monetary policy of national economies. In this regard, it seems extremely urgent to solve the problem which reveals the features of the studied market development, as well as the possibility of its forecasting for short- and medium-term periods of time. The research subject is the process of economic and mathematical modelling of time series characterizing the bitcoin exchange rate volatility, based on the use of artificial neural networks. The purpose of the work is to search and scientifically substantiate the tools and mechanisms for developing prognostic estimates of the crypto currency market development. The paper considers the task of financial time series trend forecasting using the LSTM neural network for supply chain strategies. The time series composed of the BTC / USD currency pair data is analysed; the period analysed is a day. The authors analysed the neural network architecture, built a neural network model taking into account the heterogeneity and random volatility of the time series, developed and implemented an algorithm for solving the problem in the Python system. For training the neural network, data were used for the period from September 24, 2013, to March 17, 2019 (a total of 2002 data sets). The experiment boils down to that the constructed neural network model is trying to determine the trend of the time series for one next timeframe. The training was conducted with a "teacher". To determine the prediction error, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated. The results of the study are of practical interest for both government authorities in the field of crypto currency market regulation and for representatives of the business community, who are integrated or planning to integrate into the global crypto currency transaction system. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the use of non-legal tender currencies in regions experiencing economic turmoil and by the growing use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, I examine in a controlled, experimental laboratory setting, the acceptance of a secondary currency when a primary currency already circulates in an economy. The underlying model is an indivisible goods / indivisible money, dual currency search model similar to that in Kiyotaki and Wright (1993) and Curtis and Waller (2000). In such models, there are two pure Nash equilibria - total acceptance or total rejection of the secondary currency - and one unstable, mixed equilibrium. This mixed equilibrium is considered an artifact of the indivisibility of money and goods in the model and is often ignored. I find that when a significant friction - in this case the inability to barter - is introduced, the equilibrium tends towards complete acceptance of the secondary currency. Conversely, when barter is readily available to subjects, the equilibrium tends towards total rejection. As predicted by theory, the tendency towards one equilibrium or the other appears to be influenced by the mixed equilibrium and the related basins of attraction. © 2019},

	abstract = {The article focuses on ways to assess the origin and development of the first national currency in the world which was introduced into circulation in Venezuela in 2018. Besides, it sets the goal to find out specific features of Petro (PTR) and its operation as Venezuelan national cryptocurrency. The methodological basis consists of general scientific methods of cognition to include analysis, synthesis, and comparison. The special methods such as content analysis of official documents as well as economic analysis are also applied in the article. The research produced some key findings: recent surveys confirm its new function of becoming a convenient means of payment in the environment of the cash absence, and a means of survival for many families living in the environment of a deepening economic crisis and sanctions introduce by the USA. The main outcomes imply that the national cryptocurrency PRT has some advantages over other cryptocurrencies, one of them being the fact that unlike Bitcoin and other currencies it is issued by the Venezuelan government and has a state guarantee of reliability and stability when operating in the country. However, it is not without disadvantages, the main one being the possibility of its anonymous usage which has resulted in an increased flow of illegal transactions and a larger shadow economy which has grown significantly in Venezuela. The main conclusions drawn from the research are that the introduction of the national cryptocurrency had produced a positive impact on the economic development of the country. In fact, it resulted in an increase in the number of financial transactions within the country; it led to additional opportunities concerning exchanges with other countries and international financing of Venezuela by third parties; the cryptocurrency contributed to the integration of Venezuela into a new type of the world market. © 2020, Institute of Latin American Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences.},

What may be called the lex cryptographia of blockchain has been designed based on a rational choice vision of human behavior. Blockchain adopts a framing derived from neoclassical economics, and instantiates it in a new machinery that implements rational choice paradigms using blockchain in a semi-automatic way, across all spheres of life, and without regard to borders.

	abstract = {The net profit of investors can rapidly increase if they correctly decide to take one of these three actions: buying, selling, or holding the stocks. The right action is related to massive stock market measurements. Therefore, defining the right action requires specific knowledge from investors. The economy scientists, following their research, have suggested several strategies and indicating factors that serve to find the best option for trading in a stock market. However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market. As a result, we developed an application that observes historical price movements and takes action on real-time prices. We tested our proposal algorithm with three-Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH)-crypto coins' historical data. The experiment on Bitcoin via DRL application shows that the investor got 14.4% net profits within one month. Similarly, tests on Litecoin and Ethereum also finished with 74% and 41% profit, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.},

This paper examined a total of 67,166 panel data of financial stocks in the two emerging markets of Taiwan and China between July 2016 and April 2019, presenting the following significant findings. (1) Financial stocks in Taiwan’s market are more greatly shocked by the bitcoin and interaction effect between bitcoin and fin-tech than those in China’s market. (2) Even after changing proxy variable or autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity are considered, the asymmetric shocks on financial stocks in Taiwan’s market are still great. (3) The effects of the two variables of bitcoin and interaction with fin-tech on financial stocks are consistently important as the three-factor CAPM model. (4) Transmitted by the changes in currency supply and demand as well as exchange rate volatilities, the spillover effects of virtual currencies and financial innovation indirectly change the currency multiplier of the home country, investors’ sensibility to interest rates, and balance of import and export trades and may eventually impact the gross outputs and inflation of individual economies. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The blockchain distributed ledger technology offers a secure, transparent, verifiable, democratic, decentralised, efficient, and tamper-resistant way to record and transfer data. Now much of the discussion revolves around the attributes that determine its many potential applications as this technology is expected to help transform sectors that are hampered by inefficiencies as well as facilitate the appearance of new business models based on distributed markets and technology. Given this technological revolution has already started, the core objectives of this article are to acquaint the reader with the technology and with the current and latent applications of this innovation while recognising its potential worldwide economic impact. To accomplish these goals we review the literature encompassing both academic and professional works that refer to the characteristics and properties of the blockchain, its many existent and plausible applications, and the reasons for its anticipated global economic repercussions.

Although it is a hard-to-accept scenario, especially by the big players on the power market, the pilot projects so far demonstrate that blockchain can play a major role in the future energy market, even if the technology is still immature from the conceptual point of view. This article attempts to bring solutions to support small farmers in allowing them to use irrigation systems. It proposes to create associations of small farmers to manage this situation. For this purpose, it is proposed to use green energy using photovoltaic panels. The efficiency of the proposed system will be monitored not only by the location and type of photovoltaic panels, but also by using the new blockchain technology that stimulates innovation and growth in the energy, climate and environment sectors. To accelerate the transition to the green energy economy, a SolarCoin version similar to the Bitcoin cryptomonade is also proposed. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Information system, as an emerging discipline which is dynamic and interdisciplinary, is constantly undergoing rapid changes; therefore, one of the most critical issues is to study the topics and methodological trends in this field. This study aimed to thoroughly investigate the topics and methodologies used in information system throughout a twelve-year period (20072018). In the present study, all the articles published in the top eight information system journals were investigated based on their topics and methodologies using a literature analysis approach, and the most common topics and methodologies in such studies were then detected. The main topics addressed in this field were electronic commerce/business, information system research, and IS usage/adoption, and the survey was the dominant research methodology in this regard. Furthermore, an increase in the use of the mathematical models indicates that more accurate quantitative research methods have made this field more mature. The research findings also show that the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, social media, bitcoin and block chain, digital transformation, sharing economy, digital platform, methodology of machine learning, data mining, and text mining are the main research topics and methods which should be further studied. © 2020.

Using a weekly dataset from 2013 to 2017, our key results suggest that the frequency of Google searches leads to positive returns and a surge in Bitcoin trading volume. Shocks to search values have a positive effect, which persisted for at least a week.

Further instability related toCOVID-19 will negatively affect not only on companies and financial markets, but also on traders and investors that have been interested in saving their investment, minimizing risks, and making decisions such as how to manage their resources, how much to consume and save, when to buy or sell stocks, etc., and these decisions depend on the expectation of when to expect next critical change. Trying to help people in their subsequent decisions, we demonstrate the possibility of constructing indicators of critical and crash phenomena on the example of Bitcoin market crashes for further demonstration of their efficiency on the crash that is related to the coronavirus pandemic. For this purpose, the methods of the theory of complex systems have been used. Since the theory of complex systems has quite an extensive toolkit for exploring the nonlinear complex system, we take a look at the application of the concept of entropy in finance and use this concept to construct 6 effective entropy measures: Shannon entropy, Approximate entropy, Permutation entropy, and 3 Recurrence based entropies. We provide computational results that prove that these indicators could have been used to identify the beginning of the crash and predict the future course of events associated with the current pandemic. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

The first solution launched in Kenya in 2007, M-PESA is one of the world major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MMOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs per day. The USSD is the technology at the heart of the Mobile-money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first crypto currency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The field of action of the Blockchain has not yet completed its enlargement. The rate of unbanked is still very high in developing countries; this rate is a factor that does not favor the emergence of the economy. It is necessary to count on the mobile money to skip this obstacle (according to the World Bank) we make here the state of the art on the mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries and in Burkina-Faso. We propose a mobile-money solution based on the Blockchain, in order to increase security, trust, and move towards a federation of mobile-money platforms. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electronically signing contracts is fundamental for e-commerce transactions. The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a setup that controls and monitors the physical world around us. The advancement of these systems needs to incorporate an unequivocal spotlight on making these systems efficient. Blockchains and their inherent combination of consensus algorithms, distributed data storage, and secure protocols can be utilized to build robustness and reliability in these systems. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind bitcoins and it provides a decentralized framework to validate transactions and ensure that they cannot be modified. By distributing the role of information validation across the network peers, blockchain eliminates the risks associated with a centralized architecture. It is the most secure validation mechanism that is efficient and enables the provision of financial services, thereby giving users more freedom and power. This upcoming technology provides internet users with the capability to create value and authenticate digital information. It has the capability to revolutionize a diverse set of business applications, ranging from sharing economy to data management and prediction markets. In this paper, we present a holistic survey of various applications of CPS where blockchain has been utilized. Smart grids, health-care systems, and industrial production processes are some of the many applications that can benefit from the blockchain technology and will be discussed in the paper. © 2020 by the authors.

During the last 10 years its importance has been highlighted and many organizations worldwide have embraced it and developed innovative applications. Even though Blockchain has been adopted by many sectors, Universities are reluctant to propose new academic programs on this field at bachelor and postgraduate level and fail to efficiently educate students on Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Consequently, universities have failed to investigate the business, technical, legal and other aspects of this technology. As a result, we have the paradox where industry and economy would like to experiment and adopt Blockchain solutions but there is a lack of people with appropriate and adequate skills to work on these solutions. Obviously, this holds back the adoption and the widespread of this technology and currently there are problems in scaling up Blockchain technology. The goal of this paper is to explore the area of Blockchain education and training and propose the structure of a master program that can be used as a model. In doing so, we expand the body of knowledge and we shed light to an important area with limited available information and use cases. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings: To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value: This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

With a surplus of nuclear power generation, one of the modern tools for using excess electricity is directing it to cryptocurrency mining. The author of the article will try to calculate the possibilities of Ukrainian NPPs in the cryptoindustry market by analyzing the competitiveness, market trends and the approximate profitability of this kind of activity. The essence of the article lies in the intervention of the state energy giant in completely new activities, partial monopolization of the market and interference in the activities of decentralized cryptocurrencies, as well as the very novelty of combining two different fields of activity and the global nature of the consequences. Mining can be used to convert the underdeveloped electricity or all of Energoatom's capacities totally, but at the same time it can also affect the cryptoasset market in the field of decentralization, as the primary cost factor to affect the price of assets and allow for obtaining super-profits at a state enterprise. The author of the article tries to understand the profitability of such actions and, in general, to understand the globality of the idea. The results of the entry of the national energy giant into the cryptoasset market will change the global processes in the ecosystem of the cryptoindustry and change the situation both on the electricity market in the region and, in general, will affect the processes of globalization and unification of the financial sectors of the economy.  © 2020.

	abstract = {Spanish Law 5/2011, of 29 March, defines Social Economy as the set of economic and business activities that, in the private sphere, are carried out by entities that pursue the general economic or social interest, following the principles of the primacy of persons and the social purpose over capital, the promotion of internal solidarity and solidarity with society, and last, independence from public authorities. In other words, the Social and Solidarity Economy is a socio-economic area based on three main axes that determine its transforming character: democratic and participatory management, orientation towards human needs and commitment to the environment. In this way, it represents a new way of doing things, rather than a path towards a specific goal. In Spain, with the approval of the Social Economy Law in 2011, the sector has experienced a significant boost and growth in recent years. At the same time, new technologies are representing a disruptive change in our current society and are modifying the way we relate to each other. At this point, it is important to differentiate between the Internet of information and the Internet of value. The first is the tool that enables the free circulation of information throughout the planet and has led to the creation of new business models such as Google, Facebook or Amazon, among others. As for the Internet of value, based precisely on blockchain technology, it is the tool that makes possible to share and manage the value of assets or goods in a digital and decentralized way, without the need to depend on a trusted entity that centralizes the process. Blockchain technology, released in 2009 by Bitcoin, is a decentralized database that is distributed among a multitude of different participants. This distribution system establishes a system of group trust, since the information is distributed among different agents, it cannot be altered. Blockchain will revolution the future development of economies and societies, with a potential capable of transforming both industry and services, as well as social relations. In this case, the initiative has started in the financial sector mainly, although as it is evident, its application in the future will not have to be exclusive to that sector. The emergent development of blockchain technology and its possibilities to modify the forms of solidarity collaboration of citizens present a current challenge and a paradigm shift for the Third Sector. Today, society is changing the way to inform, to communicate and to relate. Faced with this reality, it is increasingly aware of its transforming role and driving agent of change. The significant evolution that information technologies have undergone in recent years has affected all sectors, including the Social and Solidarity Economy. For this reason, the aim of this article is to analyze the combination of the concept of Social and Solidarity Economy and blockchain, analyzing the possibilities of both areas sharing values, principles and objectives. The Social and Solidarity Economy framework developed by Chaves and Monzón (2018), as well as Corrons, Fuster and Espelt (2017), is mainly used for this purpose. In the first place, the concept of Social and Solidarity Economy and its current framework are analyzed, highlighting its three main vertebral axes. On the other hand, and based on the research led by Preukschat on blockchain, in addition to the definition of the concept, the levels at which it is stratified are identified: structure, properties, functional characteristics and usability. In order to complete the study, an analysis of the socioeconomic implications and barriers presented by this technology is presented. In short, the blockchain offers an opportunity to give authenticity to what is understood by collaborative with respect to the proposals that exist today. However, the main barriers that this technology presents are related to the implications of the current socioeconomic system. It provides freedom of action to individuals in the face of oligopolies, large corporations and States. The free exchange of crypto currencies implies no need for banks. The privacy of economic transactions implies the difficulty of taxation by States. And global and universal registration, without anyone being able to manipulate it, implies that all transactions are stored forever and, therefore, that there is no place for the right to forget or to a second chance. At present, there is a lack of research and studies that deal with this new technology, its possibilities and barriers to adapt to the consolidated concept of Social Economy. In this way, this analysis focused mainly on the study of existing literature, shows how blockchain technology has become the new paradigm in the Third Sector and how it can be the basic tool for changing the behavior of citizens in solidarity issues. In the near future, the disruptive technologies are called to cause a great impact in the traditional systems in benefit of the citizens, forcing to a vindication of the inefficient and obsolete current schemes. Here is where blockchain technology, configured in a way compatible with the principles of the Social Economy, can become a key tool that strengthens the Social Economy sector, that allows it to continue growing up and that manages to increase the impact of the aims of the entities that make it up. © 2019 CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa.},

	abstract = {Although Bitcoin was intended to be a decentralized digital currency, in practice, mining power is quite concentrated. This fact is a persistent source of concern for the Bitcoin community. We provide an explanation using a simple model to capture miners’ incentives to invest in equipment. In our model, n miners compete for a prize of fixed size. Each miner chooses an investment qi, incurring cost ciqi, and then receives reward (Formula presented.), for some α ≥ 1. When ci = cj for all i, j, and α = 1, there is a unique equilibrium where all miners invest equally. However, we prove that under seemingly mild deviations from this model, equilibrium outcomes become drastically more centralized. In particular, ▬ When costs are asymmetric, if miner i chooses to invest, then miner j has market share at least (Formula presented.). That is, if miner j has costs that are (e.g.) 20% lower than those of miner i, then miner j must control at least 20% of the total mining power. ▬ In the presence of economies of scale (α > 1), every market participant has a market share of at least (Formula presented.), implying that the market features at most (Formula presented.) miners in total. We discuss the implications of our results for the future design of cryptocurrencies. In particular, our work further motivates the study of protocols that minimize “orphaned” blocks, proof-of-stake protocols, and incentive compatible protocols. © Nicholas Arnosti and S.

Advantages include: code openness, anonymity, decentralization, emission, and reliability. Disadvantages include lack of guarantees, instability, risk of prohibition and possible loss. A model to forecast bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange rate is proposed and substantiated mathematically. The observations are the basis to develop a hypothesis: the faster the cryptocurrency (e.g. bitcoin) is mined, the more difficult it is to forecast bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange rate. Certain factors emphasize which may affect the cryptocurrency exchange rate: trade wars of the USA with other export-oriented world economies (China); advent of IEO as the alternative for ICO and new drivers connected with the interest in cryptocurrency; FATF recommendations for market control, the entry of world giants (e.g. Facebook) into the crypto-market and the development of the stablecoin market. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

Significant indicators of "Hierarchical changes Digital Economy Real Gross Output by Industry" determining the global economic profile of Digital Economy are revealed. In the article the necessity of transformation of the economic profile of Russia in the direction of sustainability that will allow the use of promising technological approaches for the conservation and sustainable dynamics of development are proved. This is fully in line with the process of fundamental changes to achieve maximum economic growth with the use of innovative technologies, implemented within the framework of the concept of the limits of the growth of The Club of Rome. As a rule, the processes of change can be either gradual through simple improvements or more radical - associated with structural changes. The application of radical changes is associated with the need to provide reliable, proven knowledge. Technological foresight should become less expensive, maintaining high quality. The natural candidate for this role are "Big Data", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain" - attributes of Digital Economy. The conducted analysis of the Russian digital economy profile, based on the assessment of changes in big data "Rank and Score" and ranking by "Indicator" and "Index", revealed the most sensitive elements of the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile. Big data "Global Innovation Index 2018" ("World international intellectual property organization") were used for the analysis. The cumulate analysis of big data changes "Rank and Score" and ranking by "Indicator" and "Index" allowed depicting the scheme of the the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile. Considering the dominant position of big data "Indicator" - "Innovation Output Sub-index", as well as "Strength" and "Weakness", the dominant factors that determine the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile were identified. Among the subsidizing factors the most risk-taking is Domestic "credit to private sector and market scale" and ICT "use and business model creation" were pointed out. The Russian resource-based economy is highly dependent on foreign capital and technology, especially at the stage of changing over from the fifth to the sixth wave of the Kondratiev wave. At the same time the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile highlights the essential role of Tertiary "education and enrolment". Most Russian firms urgently need addition to the stock human (intellectual) capital.

	abstract = {In the past, research on blockchain technology has addressed security and privacy concerns within intelligent transportation systems for critical V2I and V2V communications that form the backbone of Internet of Vehicles. Within trucking industry, a recent trend has been observed towards the use of blockchain technology for operations. Industry stakeholders are particularly looking forward to refining status quo contract management and vehicle maintenance processes through blockchains. However, the use of blockchain technology for enhancing vehicle performance in fleets, especially while considering the fact that modern-day intelligent vehicles are prone to cyber security threats, is an area that has attracted less attention. In this paper, we demonstrate a case study that makes use of blockchains to securely optimize the fuel economy of fleets that do package pickup and delivery (P&D) in urban areas. We implement a consortium blockchain infrastructure, as opposed to a fully public blockchain (similar to the blockchain underlying Bitcoin) which is arguably not real-time or well suited for this safety-critical application. By leveraging in real-time a fleet vehicle's powertrain status, geospatial traffic data, along with driver information, the fleet vehicle acts as a node ready for data transactions in the blockchain network. Each such vehicle in the fleet communicates with its local central hub, and these secure exchanges of data and information act as immutable blockchain transactions. Consensus within the fleet is established when multiple vehicles report data updates for a given subregion in the fleet route map. The proposed infrastructure will support a fleet route planning algorithm running on the local hub, responsible for optimizing fuel economy for the fleet, increasing its reliability and credibility. © 2019 SAE International.

	abstract = {Purpose: In the past few years, several countries have begun to drastically change their economies to be entirely cash free. The point of this policy change is to hopefully prevent the amount of crime that results from the proliferation of cash. However, there are potential negative consequences to this policy change that receive little to no attention and there are several misconceptions regarding the opportunistic nature and resourcefulness of organized crime. As such, this paper aims to attempt to study these potentially negative consequences to provide some warning to countries adopting a cashless economic policy. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper relying upon an understanding of the literature in the fields of sociology, anthropology, psychology and criminology as applied to the topic of money and economic policy. Findings: This paper discusses numerous negative effects to adopting a cashless economic policy, to include the proliferation of underground financing through the hawala system and organized criminal channels, the increased use of Bitcoin, the more difficult task of tracking currency through bank reporting requirements, and the potential effect of increasing other crimes, which are harder to track. Research limitations/implications: This is an entirely conceptual paper. As such, it is not able to state definitively whether the outcomes discussed will occur or to what extent it may occur. Practical implications: This paper could help to serve as a warning for governments wishing to adopt a cashless economic policy, and it may encourage those countries to hopefully develop safeguards to prevent some of the potentially negative effects that might result. Social implications: This paper expands upon the understanding of money and the various ways that individuals may adapt or react culturally, psychologically or violently to changes in monetary policy or the form of currency itself. Originality/value: There have been few if any paper discussing the consequences of cashless economic policies and its implications toward organized crime. This paper is unique in both the subject matter being discussed and the conceptual arguments it puts forth. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

All of them stem from the distinctive advantages of Blockchain technology; volatility, trust, transparency and reliability. Blockchain already affects the banking and accounting sectors, and all its economy-abided activities. Under this context, the purpose of this study is to explore the knowledge and the attitude of Greek accountants towards Blockchain technology and its advantages and disadvantages with regards to the accounting area. For the analysis, a convenient sample of 100 Greek accountants was used. Results reveal that Greek accountants use digital infrastructure and technology, but they report low knowledge on Blockchain technology and lack of trust in using it for their transactions. The questionnaire has been factor analyzed and the following factors emerged: (a) The attitude of the accountants, (b) The need for validated files and reliability of sources, (c) The reliability of Blockchain technology, and (d) The need to eliminate intermediaries. Implications for providing more training through seminars and education for the accounting sector, businesses and employees are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With the recent advances in the Blockchain technology, and due to its decentralized nature, it has been a much considered approach for solving issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector, in particular, for IoT payment platforms. As Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments are fundamental in the IoT economy, the development of Blockchain-based payment platforms, using cryptocurrency, is continuously increasing as it enables a pure M2M, secure and private financial transactions. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies have a higher index of volatility, which makes it essential to understand the movement of their prices, as a first step to optimize Blockchain-based M2M payment transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that deals with this challenge from a descriptive, as well as predictive points of view. We use Hidden Markov Models to describe cryptocurrencies historical movements to predict future movements with Long Short Term Memory networks. To evaluate the proposed hybrid model, we have chosen 2-minute frequency Bitcoin data from Coinbase exchange market. Our proposed model proved its effectiveness compared to traditional time-series forecasting models, ARIMA, as well as a conventional LSTM. © 2019 IEEE.},

Thanks to the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain in publicly available, and considering that it shows properties of a real economy, Bitcoin is becoming more and more often subject of a number of studies. One of the hardest task in this field, yet interesting also from a non specialist point of view, is the bitcoin price correlation and prediction. In this paper we present a methodological framework for the bitcoin exchange graph analysis which helps in focusing only on restricted time spans that show interesting dynamics of the bitcoin price. We also present our study on three separate time spans and show that empirical correlations can be found between the bitcoin price and some bitcoin exchange graph measures. Lastly, with our framework we are also able to detect some unexpected behaviour from particular users which tend to pile up big amounts of bitcoin over the selected time spans. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Blockchain offers a distributed and secure system for data storage and value transactions. Its applications are springing up in multiple fields. The Chinese government is considering these trends with great caution. Initial coin offering has been banned in China since September 2017. By contrast, an official white paper on China's blockchain technology, which was released in May 2018, said that blockchain technology will be widely applied in the real economy of China within 3 years. In a recent panel discussion held by National Science Review, experts talked about related topics. Their opinions may provide a quick view of the future development of blockchain in China and abroad.

	abstract = {The world economy is embracing the next generation currency, i.e., cryptocurrencies, which dates back to 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto made Bitcoin publicly available. Rooted from the nature of decentralization and anonymity of blockchain, the cryptocurrencies have, unfortunately, been leveraged for illicit activities by the criminals. The good news is that typical cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have to publicly publish their transactions, known as a graph, to retain their ultimate goal of trustless and decentralized transaction verification, which lends law enforcement a means to deanonymizing cryptocurrencies. At meantime, graph learning is an extremely powerful tool to extract the latent features of each vertex in a graph to fulfill various tasks, such as, classifying graph vertices. In this work, we discuss the promises and challenges of exploiting graph learning to deanonymizing cryptocurrencies, which can aid the cyberfighters to circumvent cryptocurrency-based illicit activities. © 2019 IEEE.},

Dollars are supplied by a central bank to achieve its inflation target, while the Bitcoin supply grows deterministically.

Price volatility therefore does not invalidate the medium-of-exchange function. Bitcoin block rewards are not a tax on Bitcoin holders: they are financed with a Dollar tax.

The Trump administration risks creating a more fragmented global economy, and has started the biggest global trade war to date. The various sides are still on tenterhooks and threatening to impose additional tariffs worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Using deadweight loss (also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency) and Harberger’s triangle, this study shows that the trade war is devastating not just for the US and China, but for the entire global economy: (i) the prices of items that directly affect consumers’ welfare will rise; (ii) firms will face extra costs for exports; (iii) investors will become more nervous; (iv) some investors will diversify into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; (v) the trade war could turn into a currency war; (vi) even developed countries could be hit by the trade war; and (vii) tariffs applied on developing countries’ exports would rise steeply.

Smart contracts provides inherent benefits for financial institutions such as investment banking, retail banking, and insurance. This technology is widely used within Ethereum, an open source block-chain platform, from which the data has been extracted to conduct the experiments. In this work, we propose an multi-dimensional approach to find and predict smart contracts interactions only based on their crypto-currency exchanges. This approach relies on tensor modeling combined with stochastic processes. It underlines actual exchanges between smart contracts and targets the predictions of future interactions among the community. The tensor analysis is also challenged with the latest graph algorithms to assess its strengths and weaknesses in comparison to a more standard approach.},

	abstract = {The blockchain is a state of the art technology which is directly associated with the process of mining cryptocurrencies. However, this technology can be practically applied in many areas of the national economy, including oil and gas industry. For example, the blockchain can be useful in solving problems related to the confirming the integrity of primary geological and geophysical data during remote monitoring of the well construction process by excluding the influence of human factor. This technology is referred to as the industrial blockchain and requires consistent encryption and data distribution on storage locations in peer-to-peer network. Any modification of the primary geological and geophysical data in the blockchain system, on any of the computers/equipment in any block, will automatically detected by all participants of the blockchain network. The system of ensuring the integrity and invariability of the received and transmitted data will work as long as at least a single of the network is operated. Hacking such a system is not feasible and cost-effective because the potential attackers have to break through every block, as well as copies of the database on every computer and equipment in the network. This requires a potential attacker to have unique computing resources, which is currently not available. In practice, the reliability of blockchain platforms is confirmed by many years of experience in the bitcoin mining system based on the blockchain principles. The implementation of the blockchain platform in the oil and gas service allowed to ensure and guarantee the reliability of primary geological and geophysical data obtained from wells in real time, to reduce the risks of unauthorized changes. The reliability of the primary data reduces the risks of erroneous management decisions, made by the processing and analysis of these primary well data. © 2018, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

	abstract = {Blockchain has many benefits including decentralization, availability, persistency, consistency, anonymity, auditability and accountability, and it also covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, reputation system, Internet of Things, sharing economy to public and social services. Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technologies through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that more and more important research is to develop basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing theory and game models) for mining management and consensus mechanism, performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages, which are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express three key performance measures: (a) The average number of transactions in the queue, (b) the average number of transactions in a block, and (c) the average transaction-confirmation time. Finally, we use numerical examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model here is simple only under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: Whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: Governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform. © 2016, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

The main question in the debate seems to be, is bitcoin valued in direct use? The present paper contends that with respect to the regression theorem, this issue has no bearing on bitcoin’s genesis, because it is relevant only when a new medium of exchange arises out of a pure barter economy. The debate is therefore predicated on a misinter pretation of the theorem. However, the issue of bitcoin’s direct-use value, if it has one, does have relevance in assessing the likelihood it will become a generally-accepted medium of exchange—i.e. money. © 2015, Ludwig Von Mises Institute.

Bitcoin technology currently lacks protection with respect to monetary transfers, and its structure is not endorsed by the governments. Yet, understanding the concept of trust is fundamental to Bitcoin technology and digital currency economy. This paper offers a review of relevant work on cryptocurrency and trust in HCI, and critically examines its value in understanding the issues of trust in Bitcoin technology. Several limitations of the current theories and models of trust are identified, and a research framework is proposed to explore the specific trust challenges raised by the Bitcoin technology.

	abstract = {Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, has been celebrated as the future of money on the Internet. Although Bitcoin does present several forward- looking innovations, it also integrates a very old concept into its digital architecture: the mining of precious metals. Even though Bitcoin explicitly invokes mining as a metaphor and gold as an example for understanding the cryptocurrency, there has been little critical work on the connections between Bitcoin and previous metalist currency regimes. The following essay proposes a historical comparison with colonial South American silver mining and the global currency regime based on the New World silver peso it created as a way to interrogate Bitcoin. The comparison with colonial South America, and specifically the silver mining economy around the Cerro Rico de Potosí, will help to develop a historical and political understanding of Bitcoin’s stakes, including questions of resources, labor, energy, and ecology. Mining and the extractive apparatus that accompanies it always imply massive- scale earthworks that reshape the planet itself, a process known as terraforming. The Potosí comparison will reveal Bitcoin to form part of a similar process of digital primitive accumulation we can provisionally name cryptoforming. ©2017 by the Society for the History of Technology.

Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

New business models and regulatory environments disrupt more traditional fee-based strategies, and new entrants seek to displace legacy players by leveraging new mobile platforms and new sources of data. In this increasingly diversified industry landscape, start-ups and established players are attempting to embed payment in ‘social’ experience through novel technologies of accounting for trust. This imagination of the social, however, is being materialized in gated platforms for payment, accounting, and exchange. This paper explores the ambiguous politics of such experiments, specifically those, like Bitcoin or the on-demand sharing economy, that delineate an economic imaginary of ‘just us’ – a closed and closely guarded community of peers operating under the illusion that there are no mediating institutions undergirding that community. This provokes questions about the intersection of payment and publics. Payment innovators’ attenuated understanding of the social may, we suggest, evacuate the nitty-gritty of politics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {The article provides a comparative analysis of the volatility of the leading national fiat currencies and their transnational anonymous analogues, which received the slang name "cryptocurrency". Volatility is the most important financial indicator in the management of financial flows, as a measure of the risk of using a financial instrument at a specified period of time. Cryptocurrency mining technology is available to the general public and has become an innovative phenomenon. The latest financial phenomena need to be investigated, so it is necessary to conduct a multilateral scientific analysis, identification, and comparison of cryptocurrency with fiat currency. The aim of this study is to obtain new estimates of cryptocurrency based on the use of tools such as GARCH-model, simple historical volatility (SHV) and developed by the author's toolkit, which is based on the Chaikin method. The methodological basis of the research is logical, econometric, economic and statistical methods of analysis, technical and fundamental analysis, and method of scientific visualization. The calculated volatility estimates are based on the Central Bank's data on currency rates and investigated using named three models. The article for the first time presents the results of comparison of volatility of the leading fiat currencies (US dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen) and the most popular today so-called cryptocurrencies (bicoin, litecoin, ethereum, and monero). Estimation of volatility showed that the volatility of bitcoin is significantly higher than fiat money. In this regard, it is concluded that the recognition of cryptocurrency, in particular bitcoin, as a real money is premature, not only due to the lack of regulations of a certain cryptocurrency as a legal tender, but also on the grounds of violation of essential requirements for the properties of the currency, such as a low level of volatility. © 2018 OEconomia.

	abstract = {We employ a monetary model with endogenous search and random consumption preferences to consider the extent to which a government can ban an alternative currency, like bitcoin. We define a ban as a policy whereby government agents refuse to accept an alternative currency and mete out punishments to private agents caught using it. After identifying monetary equilibria where an alternative currency is accepted, we then derive the conditions under which a ban might deter its use. As in earlier studies, we show that a government of sufficient size can prevent an alternative currency from circulating without relying on punishments. We also show that, given its size, a government can ban an alternative currency so long as it is willing and able to mete out sufficiently severe punishments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A multidimensional financial system could provide benefits for individuals, companies, and states. Instead of top-down control, which is destined to eventually fail in a hyperconnected world, a bottom-up creation of value can unleash creative potential and drive innovations. Multiple currency dimensions can represent different externalities and thus enable the design of incentives and feedback mechanisms that foster the ability of complex dynamical systems to self-organize and lead to a more resilient society and sustainable economy. Modern information and communication technologies play a crucial role in this process, as Web 2.0 and online social networks promote cooperation and collaboration on unprecedented scales. Within this contribution, we discuss how one dimension of a multidimensional currency system could represent socio-digital capital (Social Bitcoins) that can be generated in a bottom-up way by individuals who perform search and navigation tasks in a future version of the digital world. The incentive to mine Social Bitcoins could sustain digital diversity, which mitigates the risk of totalitarian control by powerful monopolies of information and can create new business opportunities needed in times where a large fraction of current jobs is estimated to disappear due to computerisation. © 2016, The Author(s).},

An economy in which Bitcoin is the dominant currency would be a more volatile and harsher economy, in which the government would have limited tools to fight recessions and where financial panics, once started, would be hard to stop. A key aspect of the Bitcoin protocol is that the total number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, after which no more will ever be issued. This makes Bitcoin appealing to many people because something that will never increase in supply is more likely to hold its value. The problem is that in the event of a crisis, there would also be no way to add liquidity to the system, as more Bitcoins cannot be printed.},

	abstract = {It is predicted that cryptocurrencies will play an important role in the global economy. Therefore, it is prudent for us to understand the importance and monetary value of such cryptocurrencies, and strategize our investments accordingly. One of the ways to obtain cryptocurrency is via mining. As solo mining is not possible because of the computational requirements, pool mining has gained popularity. In this paper, we focus on Bitcoin and its pools. With more than 20 pools in the network of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it becomes challenging for a new miner to decide the pool he must join such that the profit is maximized. We use prospect theory to predict the profit that a specific miner, given his hash rate power and electricity costs, is expected to make from each pool. A utility value is calculated for each pool based on its recent performance, hash rate power, total number of the pool members, reward distribution policy of the pool, electricity fee in the new miner's region, pool fee, and the current Bitcoin value. Then, based on these parameters during a certain time duration, the most profitable pool is found for that miner. We show how the utility values from a pool varies with electricity fee and dollar equivalent of a Bitcoin. To find the accuracy of our predictions, we mine Bitcoin by joining 5 different pools- AntPool, F2Pool, BTC.com, Slushl'ool, and BatPool. Using an Antminer 55 for each pool, we mine Bitcoin for 40 consecutive days. Results reveal that our prospect theoretic predictions are consistent with what we actually mine; however predictions using expected utility theory are not as close. © 2017 IEEE.},

We apply an economic analysis of blockchains based on both new institutional economics and public choice economics.Our main focus is on the economics of why banks exist as organizations (rather than a world in which all financial transactions occurring in markets), and how banks are then impacted by technological change that affects transaction costs.Our core argument is that blockchains are more than just a new technology to be applied by banks, but rather compete with banks as organizations, enabling banking transactions to shift out of centralized hierarchical organizations and back into decentralized markets. Blockchains are a new institutional technology—because of how they affect transaction costs in financial markets—that will fundamentally re-order the governance of the production of banking services. We then explore this implication through broader political economy lens in which banking moves out of organizations and deeper into markets. We examine this as a form of institutional economic evolution in which the boundary of catallaxy—i.e., a self-organized economy—is enlarged, at the margin of the banking sector. Such institutional competition enables evolutionary discovery in the institutions of banking. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

As Bitcoin is considered the leading type of DCVC in terms of value and volume, its early beginnings in South Africa are probed. Although regulation should follow innovation, awareness of the VC ecosystem will not only warrant appropriate regulatory intervention when the time comes, but will also enable the growth and development opportunities associated with VCs. South Africa has not promulgated any legislation pertaining to VCs. The potential applicability of all current legislation and regulations relevant to VCs calls for in-depth research.

The story of MazaCoin is one of an attempt to unite two apparently divergent sociotechnical assemblages: (1) a libertarian, elite technology of cryptocurrency, and (2) a richly traditional indigenous community with a deep desire for cultural survivance, bound up in a precarious economy left behind in the wake of more than a century of genocide.},

It can also be effectively applied to build programmable finance and programmable society, which has been widely used in digital payment, financial asset disposal, multi-signature contract, cloud computing, Internet of things, sharing economy and other fields. The survey describes the basic concepts of smart contract technology, its whole life cycle, basic classification and structure, key technology, the art of the state, as well as its application scenarios and the main technology platforms. Its problems encountered at present are also discussed. Finally, based on the theoretical knowledge of the smart contract, we set up the Ethereum experimental environment and develop a system of crowdsale contract. The survey is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research of smart contract based on blockchain technology. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.},

Each offers a theory not just of money, but also of relations, identities, and the larger imaginaries we call ‘society’ and ‘the economy’. In particular, they offer distinct visions of what it means to be a ‘peer’ in a peer-to-peer money system, and perhaps, a peer-to-peer society.

The aim of our paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the payment and investment features of Bitcoin, and their implications for the conduct of e-commerce. Since network externality theory suggests that the value of a network and its take-up are interlinked, we investigate both adoption and price formation. We discover that its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin's popularity, the sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants who have adopted this technology, and we model the share of sales paid for with this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. Our analysis examines how country-, customer-, and company-specific characteristics interact with the proportion of sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company features, use of other payment methods, customers' knowledge about Bitcoin, and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are significant determinants. The results will be of interest to traders who seek to understand factors driving prices and will help to inform vendors as to the most favorable circumstances for adopting the currency for online transactions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Answering this question requires obtaining collective behavioural traces generated by the activity of a large number of actors. Digital currencies offer a unique possibility tomeasure socio-economic signals fromsuch digital traces. Here,we focus on Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has experienced periods of rapid increase in exchange rates (price) followed by sharp decline;we hypothesize that these fluctuations are largely driven by the interplay between different social phenomena. We thus quantify four socio-economic signals about Bitcoin from large datasets: price on online exchanges, volume of word-of-mouth communication in online social media, volume of information search and user base growth. By using vector autoregression, we identify two positive feedback loops that lead to price bubbles in the absence of exogenous stimuli: one driven bywordof mouth, and the other by newBitcoin adopters.We also observe that spikes in information search, presumably linked to external events, precede drastic price declines. Understanding the interplay between the socio-economic signals we measured can lead to applications beyond cryptocurrencies to other phenomena that leave digital footprints, such as online social network usage. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology and its applications have played an important role to overcome challenges in numerous areas of the life. However, most current blockchain projects have concentrated on financial model by using existing platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to generate tokens without the development of the technological features. Unfortunately, the decentralization has several challenges which cannot be adopted by our current political, economic and social systems. The fundamental technical problem of current blockchain algorithm is that 'performance inefficiency' could not be solved, in comparison with the central server system. In addition, the client software cannot establish conventions for making decisions about the future direction of the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, users' completed anonymity and the absence of a responsible person are also open problems of decentralization. To this end, this paper proposes an alternative method, dubbed RCANE which is semi-centralized network of parallel blockchain and APoS (Authorized Proof of Stake), whose purpose is to solve the above challenges of current blockchain and comply with our preconceived perspectives of the current political, social, and economic systems to build up an ecosystem for economy, society and politics. Several experiments are conducted to show the executability of RCANE Project. © 2018 IEEE.},

We perform a measurement analysis of CryptoLocker, a family of ransomware that encrypts a victim's files until a ransom is paid, within the Bitcoin ecosystem from September 5, 2013 through January 31, 2014. Using information collected from online fora, such as reddit and BitcoinTalk, as an initial starting point, we generate a cluster of 968 Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker. We provide a lower bound for CryptoLocker's economy in Bitcoin and identify 795 ransom payments totalling 1,128.40 BTC ($310,472.38), but show that the proceeds could have been worth upwards of $1.1 million at peak valuation. By analyzing ransom payment timestamps both longitudinally across CryptoLocker's operating period and transversely across times of day, we detect changes in distributions and form conjectures on CryptoLocker that corroborate information from previous efforts. Additionally, we construct a network topology to detail CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure and obtain auxiliary information on the CryptoLocker operation. Most notably, we find evidence that suggests connections to popular Bitcoin services, such as Bitcoin Fog and BTC-e, and subtle links to other cybercrimes surrounding Bitcoin, such as the Sheep Marketplace scam of 2013. We use our study to underscore the value of measurement analyses and threat intelligence in understanding the erratic cybercrime landscape. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto gave rise to the "Bitcoin Blockchain", creating the first block of the chain hashing on his computer's central processing unit (CPU). Since then, the hash calculations to mine Bitcoin have been getting more and more complex, and consequently the mining hardware evolved to adapt to this increasing difficulty. Three generations of mining hardware have followed the CPU's generation. They are GPU's, FPGA's and ASIC's generations. This work presents an agent-based artificial market model of the Bitcoin mining process and of the Bitcoin transactions. The goal of this work is to model the economy of the mining process, starting from GPU's generation, the first with economic significance. The model reproduces some "stylized facts" found in real-time price series and some core aspects of the mining business. In particular, the computational experiments performed can reproduce the unit root property, the fat tail phenomenon and the volatility clustering of Bitcoin price series.

At the same time, the existing regulatory mechanisms and legislation do not create optimal conditions for the development of the market of new financial instruments and technologies in Russia today. There are socio-economic risks, the key ones including an increase in the outflow of capital and innovative projects to other countries, a lack of confidence on the part of potential investors in new financial instruments, a decrease in the stability of traditional financial institutions. On this basis, the following tasks have been set in this article. To consider the terminology in the field of digital economy from the theoretical aspect; to identify trends and justify the need for digitalization of economic processes based on the use of new financial technologies; to reveal the informative characteristics of financial technologies promising for Russia. This article ends with a conclusion that the development of the digital economy in Russia is due to the need to ensure the information and economic security of the state, realize the potential of the new economy to improve the standard of living and national well-being through the introduction of innovative communication and financial technologies.

	abstract = {The use of blockchain technology to track physical assets is not new. However, the state of the art concepts are not applicable due to several limitations. One limitation is the scalability of blockchains with regard to the number of transactions that can be processed by the network. The well-established technology in tracking products is based on RFID chips that can be cloned. This paper provides insights into how objects can be protected and monitored by a varnish with a unique crack pattern, as an example of a Physical Unclonable Function. The perceptual hash of the unique pattern is used to encrypt the associated data to ensure privacy. Instead of logging each event on the blockchain individually, which is not possible due to the limited transaction throughput, OriginStamp is used to preserve data integrity on the blockchain. OriginStamp aggregates events, combines them through hashing and embeds this hash into a Bitcoin transaction. Once the Bitcoin network mines the transaction into a block and confirms it, the timestamp is considered as immutable proof of existence. With this approach, the integrity of tracking data cannot be contested. In the future, the craquelure-based tracking approach could be extended to supply chain integration to secure the origin of products, including prevention of counterfeiting, securing the place of manufacture for trademark law or state surveillance of the agricultural economy. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Electronic financial transactions in the US, even those enabled by Bitcoin, have relatively high transaction costs. As a result, it becomes infeasible to make micropayments, i.e. payments that are pennies or fractions of a penny. To circumvent the cost of recording all transactions, Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997) suggested the notion of a probabilistic payment, that is, one implements payments that have expected value on the order of micro pennies by running an appropriately biased lottery for a larger payment. While there have been quite a few proposed solutions to such lottery-based micropayment schemes, all these solutions rely on a trusted third party to coordinate the transactions; furthermore, to implement these systems in today’s economy would require a a global change to how either banks or electronic payment companies (e.g., Visa and Mastercard) handle transactions. We put forth a new lottery-based micropayment scheme for any ledger-based transaction system, that can be used today without any change to the current infrastructure. We implement our scheme in a sample web application and show how a single server can handle thousands of micropayment requests per second. We analyze how the scheme can work at Internet scale.

	abstract = {A blockchain is, in its essence, an unchangeable, inviolable and transparent database distributed among a network's participants. Far from simply representing the latest innovation in ICT, blockchain could serve as a foundation for the development of new business models. Indeed, its distributed nature opens the door to the creation of a new economy characterized by greater decentralization, transparency, security and privacy. The most well-known example of blockchain is the digital currency (or cryptocurrency) Bitcoin, which aims to revolutionize the world of payments as we know it today. The remarkable appreciation of Bitcoin's value over the years has been examined by numerous studies, most of which trying to determine what are the drivers influencing its price. This study is intended to provide some economic prospects for the future of blockchain technology, with specific reference to Bitcoin. In particular, this paper is focused on identifying the costs and revenues that the Bitcoin network supports in order to ensure its operativity. On the basis of the results emerging from this analysis, the paper addresses further considerations about the nature of cryptocurrencies and the future trend of their prices. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

It has created a platform for tremendous financial innovation, but at the same time the role of traditional regulatable financial intermediaries is bypassed. The purpose of this article is to address the important policy question of how we can capture Bitcoin’s potential benefits for the economy while addressing new regulatory challenges. To do so, we first conceptualise the Bitcoin ecosystem through the layered model of internet architecture. Second, we apply the layers principle of internet governance to identify control points and guidelines for regulation that respect the integrity of the layers. Third, we conclude with the need for governments to adopt an adaptive and novel regulatory approach to ensure that society can benefit from Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential. This work forms a baseline for further understanding of the governance of Bitcoin and the various actors within the ecosystem based on the layers principle of internet architecture. © 2014, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

	abstract = {The structure of the cyber underground’s economy originated from legitimate uses of the Pay-Per-Install (PPI) business model, in which entrepreneurs solicited willing clients to promote Internet advertising sales and informational data [Stevens, 2009]. Since the advent of spam filters and black-lists, where users and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) prevented most PPI providers from delivering advertisements legitimately, an underground economy has evolved using the PPI business model to promote Exploit as a Service (EaaS) and Malware as a Service (MaaS) [Paganini 2013]. To prevent detection of their activities EaaS and MaaS providers use multiple anonymous proxy and onion services, multiple tiers of security to mask one layer of their business from other layers, and additional obfuscation techniques to thwart law enforcement agencies. Monitoring financial transactions has been a major weapon for law enforcement and government agencies, which collaborate with corporations to provide financial data for suspect currency transactions. To counter this capability and prevent detection of financial transactions, cyber criminals have adopted crypto currencies as a secure means to pay clients or receive payments while masking their transactions, identity and avoid taxes. Since the initial occurrence of crypto currency in 2009 (BITCOIN), over 100 crypto currency exchanges now exist, hosting 1147 unique crypto coins ranging from $<1USD to >$11,000 USD in monetary value [Crypto-Currency, 2017]. Many on-line stores now accept crypto-coins and crypto currency banks have been established to anonymously store specific types of crypto coins. Government and law enforcement agencies, such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [Drandreagalli 2013] are ill equipped to track and act upon crypto transactions in the same manner they are able to monitor and track government-sponsored currencies. A crackdown by the US government on a virtual currency reserve was not supported by other countries to include Great Britain, which released a statement to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) stating, “not everyone involved (in crypto currency) is shady or involved in criminal activity—principally those outside the United States”. This international rift in fiscal policies are mirrored by US agencies, as legitimacy for crypto currency is gaining traction from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other US government organizations; facilitating the ability of legitimate businesses to accept crypto currency for payment of goods and services. The intent of this research is to demonstrate the transition from government currencies to crypto currencies for purchase and redistribution of EaaS and MaaS activities, creating greater competition and reducing prices through an anonymous transaction process. The authors will provide an explanation of crypto currency, how it is produced, currency distribution, and the ability to conduct anonymous transactions across borders and legal jurisdictions. The authors will present a case study which creates and exchanges crypto currency with minimal risk of detection while engaging in MaaS and EaaS transactions. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

	abstract = {Electronic money is a compound of currency and technology which takes its rise around 1970 while benefiting at the same time from the miniaturization in electronics and the democratization of informatics. Electronic money covers the payment cards with magnetic tape, chip cards, the contact-less payments by card, mobile phone, or tablet PC, and the logical moneys (often called ‘virtual moneys’ such as the Bitcoin, the Litecoin, the PPCoin, the Ven, the Linden dollar, the ‘gold’ as in the digital game World of Warcraft). These forms of electronic moneys have three common properties: the cryptography, the network, and the privileges. Cryptography conditions the ways to access the money. The network represents the kind of regulation of electronic moneys. The privileges differentiate the use of electronic moneys. Each form of electronic money does not match these three conditions identically because all are not equipped with the same technologies and the same related services. Nevertheless, the presence of these three properties within all forms of electronic money leads to a better understanding of how such functionalized money deeply changes our view on modern society. Indeed, whereas the economic standard model considers money as a veil hiding economic reality, the case of electronic money lets us think, on the contrary, since the swell period of the early 1970s, of the real economy as veiling socio-economic reality, which has to be considered as a kind of a Ponzi scheme. While this scheme becomes the core of societal reality, the economic laws and their sociological as well as political equivalents, functional differentiation, and democracy are no longer the pillars of modernity. They hide this reality as fetishes enabling its order. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

The theoretical interpretation of the process of cryptocurrencies occurrence in the context of definitions of electronic funds and virtual payment services is carried out. Cryptocurrencies show impressive dynamics of growth, but this is due to the rapidly growing public interest, which provokes demand in the market and limits supply. The study clarifies the growth factors of the cryptocurrency, gives an assessment of the prospects and forecasts various scenarios for the cryptocurrency system development. In the course of the correlationregression analysis of the Bitcoin price dynamics, it is determined that the observations approximations best correspond to the polynomial model of the third degree and the exponential model. For both of them, the determination coefficient is close to the boundaries of the confidence interval. Based on the analysis of the Bitcoin market price dynamics, it is concluded that the demand for cryptocurrency has been formed not by its intrinsic value, but by market expectations, as well as by the level of interest and involvement of participants in this virtual network (via network effect). Based on the example of the financial market, it is shown that the possibilities of blockchain technology are versatile. The prospects for its development are determined by the needs of decentralization in order to improve the sustainability and security of business processes. © 2018.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies are central to what has been described as a new ‘smart social contract’. With blockchain, individual cryptographic identity becomes the basis for new forms of money and for a whole suite of restructured social, political and financial transactions. But what do these developments signal for feminist engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a ‘feminist weapon’. But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered, racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend representations of gold along with the ‘metallism’ surrounding blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of fundamental value returns, together with related associations of essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background for the ‘new libertarianism’ whose ascendency now overshadows the neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some decades. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {An implicit goal of Bitcoin's reward structure is to diffuse network influence over a diverse, decentralized population of individual participants. Indeed, Bitcoin's security claims rely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently large portion of the network's overall computational power. Unfortunately, rather than participating independently, most Bitcoin miners join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largely directs the pool's activity, leading to a consolidation of power. Recently, the largest mining pool has accounted for more than half of network's total mining capacity. Relatedly, "hosted mining" service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale, tempting them away from independent participation. We argue that the prevalence of mining coalitions is due to a limitation of the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle - specifically, that it affords an effective mechanism for enforcing cooperation in a coalition. We present several definitions and constructions for "nonoutsourceable" puzzles that thwart such enforcement mechanisms, thereby deterring coalitions. We also provide an implementation and benchmark results for our schemes to show they are practical. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

We also provide a holistic view on how ransomware attacks have evolved during this period by analyzing 1, 359 samples that belong to 15 different ransomware families. Our results show that, despite a continuous improvement in the encryption, deletion, and communication techniques in the main ransomware families, the number of families with sophisticated destructive capabilities remains quite small. In fact, our analysis reveals that in a large number of samples, the malware simply locks the victim’s computer desktop or attempts to encrypt or delete the victim’s files using only superficial techniques. Our analysis also suggests that stopping advanced ransomware attacks is not as complex as it has been previously reported. For example, we show that by monitoring abnormal file system activity, it is possible to design a practical defense system that could stop a large number of ransomware attacks, even those using sophisticated encryption capabilities. A close examination on the file system activities of multiple ransomware samples suggests that by looking at I/O requests and protecting Master File Table (MFT) in the NTFS file system, it is possible to detect and prevent a significant number of zero-day ransomware attacks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The last two decades have suggested a post-scarcity economy, where infinite copies of attractive digital things have a price approaching $0. Today, there are thousands of people loyal to the ideology and opportunities that Bitcoin represents. They imagine a world where economies are less dependent on banks and governments, and they're actually using Bitcoin, often in disruptive ways. Since Bitcoin is essentially a kind of transaction log, where past transactions are public and known to the world, it is of great interest to prosecutors, who have called the coins 'Prosecution Futures.'.},

As opposed to the first era of the Internet, where the industry of financial and information services was dominated by intermediaries, the blockchain era is characterized by development of a new institution of trust; disruption of financial intermediation; economic inclusion of hundreds of millions of citizens in developing countries; an increase in competition and a decrease in inequality. The paper focuses on the content of key political-economic categories being redefined in the blockchain era. First, labor value gives way to creative value which is manifesting itself in cryptocurrencies. Second, exploitation of workers is replaced by digital discrimination. The blockchain revolution is a solution to the problem of discrimination against intellectual property creators, who have to hand over a large part of the value created to intermediaries. Third, capitalism characterized by information monopoly gives place to free competition based on rivalry between cryptocurrencies. Fourth, class struggle is substituted by confrontation between agents of information monopoly system and those of distributed economy. The author considers the main opposition to distributed capitalism to stem from the feudal financial system which loses ground under new conditions, where economic agents may use alternative currencies and interact directly with one other without risk and high transaction costs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © Jarunee Wonglimpiyarat, 2016.},

This paper indicates their pros and cons as alternatives to “real” money and explains their appearance as the reflection of the present trends. It also presents the possible scenarios of their development. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on the former foresight research results and literature review. It highlights the main trends in contemporary economy and their impact on financial services. The Bitcoin case is the starting point for the virtual currencies’ market analysis and construction of possible market changes scenarios. Findings – Virtual currency schemes are the reflection of present trends. They are just ahead of our times but may become a common means of payment, changing the way of providing financial services, eliminating intermediaries and marginalizing the role of financial institutions. Research limitations/implications – The multiplicity of virtual currencies and ceaseless introduction of innovations impede the presentation of the complete market picture. The lack of reliable statistical data makes the estimation of the market growth difficult. Practical implications – This paper indicates influence of technology development, virtualization and networking on payment systems’ functioning. Social implications – This paper shows the impact of environmental changes on consumers’ acceptance of virtual currencies. Originality/value – The virtual currency as a payment system is quite new and still a marginalized phenomenon. Nevertheless, the pace of virtual currency market growth after its recent introduction and appearance of Bitcoin successors seems to be the signs of future changes in financial service sector. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

He cautioned against this view and to look back to similar situations for guidance to analyze the present. Proven management tools and the underlying basic principles will continue to hold true. Drucker’s stance was demonstrated when the claim of a new economy in 1929 fell flat and again when the dotcom bubble burst after 2000. Both events saw a return to the realities of sound managerial principles. However, in 2018 there seems to be a case for things really being different this time. A review of cornerstones of engineering management practice reveals that their relevance may be decreasing due to fundamental changes in the organizational world. The current engineering management body of knowledge might be left behind in a rapidly changing business environment. Evidence through literature reviews, case studies and tours of modern businesses supports the view that the old standards are losing their importance. Subjects of much EM research highlighted in this paper are productivity, motivation, team work, continuous improvement, learning curves and organizational knowledge. Also, is there a potential for bitcoin or other digital currencies to disrupt the bases of engineering economy? Will even the world of engineering management education be disrupted by online courses reducing the need for teaching faculty? The engineering management world may soon find itself scrambling to regain lost relevance and credibility. © Copyright© (2018) by American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM).

	abstract = {The modern age has heralded a shift from the industrial society, in which natural resources are crucial input factors for the economy, towards a knowledge society. To date, sustainability literature has treated knowledge—and in particular digital artifacts—mainly as a means to the end of achieving sustainable development. In this conceptual paper, we argue that digital artifacts themselves ought also to be considered as resources, which also need to be sustainable. While over-consumption is a problem facing natural resources, with sustainable digital artifacts, underproduction, and underuse are the biggest challenges. In our view, the sustainability of digital artifacts improves their potential impact on sustainable development. A theoretical foundation for digital artifacts and their ecosystem allows us to present the relevant research on digital information, knowledge management, digital goods, and innovation literature. Based on these insights, we propose ten basic conditions for sustainable digital artifacts and their ecosystem to ensure that they provide the greatest possible benefit for sustainable development. We then apply those characteristics to four exemplary cases: Linux kernel development, Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the Wikipedia project, and the Linking Open Drug Data repositories. The paper concludes with a research agenda identifying topics for sustainability scholars and information systems academics, as well as practitioners. A number of suggestions for future studies on digital sustainability are also put forward. © 2016, The Author(s).},

Despite a growth of transaction volume and an increasing attention in the area of e-commerce, there is little academic research examining the factors influencing adoption. To fill this research gap, this paper documents an exploratory study of the key determinants and inhibitors of Bitcoin use. Drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model and a literature review, we integrate various benefits and risks of Bitcoin use to form the multidimensional constructs Perceived Benefit and Perceived Risk. We propose and empirically test a theoretical model that explains the use of Bitcoin as an online payment system for legitimate purchases and money transfers. Furthermore, we recognize several conceptual and methodological development potentialities for technology acceptance theories in the context of decentralized and sharing economy systems.},

The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © 2015 Wonglimpiyarat J.},

	abstract = {The appearance of cryptocurrencies in modern economy raises questions about the nature of this phenomenon. The first question is - if cryptocurrency a new kind of money. It is difficult to answer this question definitely because till recent time the nature of money remained to be a subject of discussion. Now we have a good founded conception, which represents modern understanding of money. It is based on two principles. The first principle is the desire for wealth which exists in any human being, and in the human society as a social community. The second principle is the equality of exchange as a law of economy. Keeping in mind these two principles, we discover that mankind during the whole its history created and used only two kinds of economic operations, which are two kinds of equal exchange: trade and credit. First common economic operation in history was trade, while credit was rather an occasional one. So, money had emerged first from trade. The trade deal was performed by two independent participants. So, the only guaranty of equality of the exchange was the own value of the commodity which was used as money. This is why trade created commodity money, and the best commodities for this task were gold and silver. Credit created a verbal or a written agreement, which was an equivalent of the value of the loan. Commodity money was inconvenient for capitalism, and capitalism created its own money from the agreement between participants of the credit deal. It was possible because capitalism created close economic relations between people. Credit money is in accordance with the requirements of capitalist economy, it performs all necessary functions, it adapts good the influence of progress, and it is convenient for various needs. Modern capitalist economy doesn't need other kinds of money. Accepting this conception, we treat cryptocurrencies as tokens of various kinds, but not as money. In spite of the word "currency" in the name, these financial instruments are not currencies but tokens suitable for transfer money and some other needs. The anonymity of the deals with these instruments, the absence of public control and some other qualities of that kind became the reason of strong demand for cryptocurrencies and of the rise of their price, especially the price of bitcoins. Flight of capital, some other illegal deals, as well, as the possibility of rapid enrichment attracted people to operations with bitcoins but the rise and fall of its price exposed the scale of risks of such operations. Nevertheless, the main merit of cryptocurrencies is the blockchain system. This system can be successfully used in various industries where exists a need for fixing big numbers of items or of operations. This reasons demand from government economic policy to be careful and wise. The state has time to wait until the processes in this sphere will become more clear and stable. The same approach must be implemented to government regulation of ICO as a new method of attracting investments for business projects. The fact that many deals of that kind were used just to take off money from people must not became a reason to ban these deals. Blockchain system, cryptocurrencies and ICO create a new civil financial society with some kind of self-regulation. Such processes are typical for contemporary time, but they don't mean introducing a new kind of money. The digital revolution will create its own way of interaction of these instruments with existing credit money, and the new system will inevitably demand some sort of state regulation. © 2018 Nauka Publishing House.

	abstract = {We develop the first basic Operational Risk perspective on key risk management issues associated with the development of new forms of electronic currency in the real economy. In particular, we focus on understanding the development of new risk types and the evolution of current risk types, as new components of financial institutions arise to cater for an increasing demand for electronic money, micro-payment systems, Virtual money and cryptographic (Crypto) currencies. The article proposes a framework of risk identification and assessment applied to Virtual and Crypto currencies from a banking regulation perspective. In doing so, it addresses the topical issues of understanding important key Operational Risk vulnerabilities and exposure risk drivers under the framework of the Basel II/III banking regulation, specifically associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies. This is critical to consider, should such alternative currencies continue to grow in utilisation to the point that they enter into the banking sector, through commercial banks and financial institutions which are beginning to contemplate their recognition in terms of deposits, transactions and exchangeability for fiat currencies. We highlight how some of the features of Virtual and Crypto currencies are important drivers of Operational Risk, posing both management and regulatory challenges that must start to be considered and addressed both by regulators, central banks and security exchanges. In this article, we focus purely on the Operational Risk perspective of banks operating in an environment where such 'electronic' Virtual currencies are available. Some aspects of this discussion are directly relevant now, while others can be understood as discussions to raise awareness of issues in Operational Risk that will arise as Virtual currency starts to interact more widely in the real economy. We propose a structure of risk analysis starting with the exposures and vulnerabilities of Virtual and Crypto currencies as the drivers of Operational Risk for these new means of exchange. Then, by using risk drivers, our approach allows us to highlight the sources of possible adverse consequences, when using or generating Virtual and Crypto currencies. These are then mapped into the risks associated to the Basel categories, providing an easier view of regulatory response, and better mitigation techniques. In addition, this will help identify and address the root causes of the Operational Risks associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies, rather than just presenting their symptoms. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to gather together the minimum units of users’ identity in the Bitcoin network (i.e. the individual Bitcoin addresses) and group them into representations of business entities, what we call “super clusters”. While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, the authors are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns (TPs), as observed during the period from 2009 to 2015. The authors are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. They conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e. gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: Data mining. Findings: Four primary business categories are identified in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. Common patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users are a “one-day” holding period for bitcoin transactions is somewhat typical. That is, a one-day effect where traders, gamblers, black market participants and miners tend to cash out on a daily basis. There seems to be a strong preference to do business within the bitcoin economy in round lot amounts, whether it is more typical of traders exchanging for fiat money, gamblers placing bets or black market goods being bought and sold. Distinct patterns of transaction behavior among the business categories and their users are flows between traders and exchanges average just around 20 BTC, and traders buy or sell on average every 11 days. Meanwhile, gamblers wager just 0.5 BTC on average, but re-bet often within the same day. Three marked regimes have evolved, as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprises (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises. This evolution of the Bitcoin economy suggests a trend toward legitimate commerce. Originality/value: The authors propose a new theoretical framework that allows investigating and exploring the network of payment relationships in the Bitcoin economy. This study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses), and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what is called “super clusters”, by using tested techniques from the literature. A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized. The novelty of this study is given by the pure user group and the TP analyses, by means of which the authors are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

At the paper's heart is the paradox that if Bitcoin succeeds in its own terms as an ideology, it will fail in practical terms as a form of money. The main reason for this is that the new currency is premised on the idea of money as a ‘thing’ that must be abstracted from social life in order for it to be protected from manipulation by bank intermediaries and political authorities. The image is of a fully mechanized currency that operates over and above social life. In practice, however, the currency has generated a thriving community around its political ideals, relies on a high degree of social organization in order to be produced, has a discernible social structure, and is characterized by asymmetries of wealth and power that are not dissimilar from the mainstream financial system. Unwittingly, then, Bitcoin serves as a powerful demonstration of the relational character of money. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {Structural changes in the world economy require a constant increase in investment flows. The main factor that determines the presence or absence of resources to finance investment processes is the amount of money in circulation. In this regard, in recent decades, the world financial system has been increasingly faced with the issue of the money supply increase. The process of increasing the currency in circulation should not get out of control; it has to satisfy the needs of world economy sustainable development and at the same time ensure the stability of the international financial markets functioning. Thus, today the issue of finding an international payment facility that would ensure the sustainable development of the world economy on the basis of a controlled growth of the money supply in circulation is an acute one. The way to solve the problem of the money in circulation optimization can be found in so-called cryptographic currencies, the leader among which nowadays is Bitcoin. The purpose of this study is to find the answer to the question: "Can Bitcoin's usage as an international means of payment be a way to solve the issue of the money in circulation optimization in order to maintain sustainable development of the world economy?" The study is based on an analysis of the statistical data available at The World Bank, Blockchain Luxembourg SA, MS Brokers Europe Limited. The methodology of the analysis is based on the use of descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, comparative and trend analysis elements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The population for the study comprised a stratified group of 1,300 Chartered Accountants among whom were Tax Practitioners, Financial Analysts, Statutory Auditors, Bankers, Accountants, Lawyers, Lecturers and other specialists in the field of Accounting. A sample of 250 Practitioners was conveniently selected for the study. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the Professional Accountants in Nigeria are willing to operate in the Cryptocurrency environment provided the Government would legislate its use. The study concluded that the legislation of Cryptocurrency or its modified form by the Federal Government of Nigeria is desirable for the protection of her economy as well as the interest of her citizens. However, government must take holistic view of the economy and scrutinize every relevant factor in the purview of the law to ensure the legislative decision is in the interest of the entire citizens. © 2018, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal.},

Its ascendancy offers up a puzzle for financial regulators and other law-enforcers worldwide, while also promising to fulfill the political visions of a group of marketanarchist cryptographers. While it is still a very small economy in absolute terms, Bitcoin also poses some interesting challenges to traditional economic institutions, and is thus an interesting case for economic sociology. Using the notion of material embeddedness, this paper examines the possible implications of a further propagation of Bitcoin. If the currency proves a success, this will have ramifications for a large number of economic institutions, such as the possibility of taxation of untraceable money, the credit economy and interest rates, and international currency control. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Indeed, some governments have already taken steps to ban or discourage the use of bitcoin. In a model with endogenous matching and random consumption preferences, we find multiple monetary equilibria including one in which bitcoin coexists with official currency. We then identify the conditions under which government transactions policy might deter the use of bitcoin. We show that such a policy becomes more difficult if some users strictly prefer bitcoin because they can avoid other users holding the official currency in the matching process. © 2016 Western Economic Association International.},

To that end, we gather and analyze posts mentioning “DDoS” on the popular Bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org. Starting from around 3 000 different posts made between May 2011 and October 2013, we document 142 unique DDoS attacks on 40 Bitcoin services. We find that 7% of all known operators have been attacked, but that currency exchanges, mining pools, gambling operators, eWallets, and financial services are much more likely to be attacked than other services. Not coincidentally, we find currency exchanges and mining pools are much more likely to have DDoS protection such as CloudFlare, Incapsula, or Amazon Cloud. We show that those services that have been attacked are more than three times as likely to buy anti-DDoS services than operators who have not been attacked. We find that big mining pools (those with historical hashrate shares of at least 5%) are much more likely to be DDoSed than small pools. We investigate Mt. Gox as a case study for DDoS attacks on currency exchanges and find a disproportionate amount of DDoS reports made during the large spike in trading volume and exchange rates in spring 2013. We conclude by outlining future opportunities for researching DDoS attacks on Bitcoin. © IFCA/Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

Distinctive characteristic properties of a set of cryptocalculation units, in particular, subsets of x-type (coin) and y-type (token) calculation units, are revealed. It is proved that these sets do not intersect. It is proposed to allocate a subset of C 2 in the set of coins, which has an additional characteristic property - functioning on the basis of a smart contract. The thesis that any settlement unit carries the cost of a resource is proved. Even for units of account with the so-called "intrinsic value" (bitcoin), the presence of a resource in its functions was found. Four characteristic properties inherent in the set of "money" (M = {money}) are disclosed and a subset DM = {digital money} is allocated, containing a set of digital Fiat money secured by the state (sets F = {fiat}) and a subset P = {private}, which is actually an addition to the set F). It is proved that cryptocurrencies have characteristic properties of the set M = {money} only within their own community. The paradox of the algorithmic guarantor, reflecting the absence of the need for formalization of algorithmic informal institutions, is formulated. Disclosed definitions of such concepts as "cryptocurrency", "token economy" and "tokenization economy". Euler circles are used to visualize the relationship between different sets of calculation units. A coherent classification of calculation units based on the characteristic properties of the identified sets is formed. The results of the study can be used to form the basis of legal regulation of the circulation of digital units of account. © 2018 Finance: Theory and Practice. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements boost the business to play a crucial role in a country’s economic success. Cryptography-based currencies, called as cryptocurrencies, are now leading the world’s economy. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges have emerged to support cryptocurrency-related services. Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin takes the lead and it is widely accepted by the world community. Lots of security issues are arising day by day and the exchange should handle all of of them sensibly. It is necessary that the exchange should be solvent all the time in terms of its assets and liabilities for its survival. For this, periodic settlement of the accounts should be done using appropriate techniques. The information exchange needed for this should be concealed from the adversaries. Cryptography-based techniques with zero-knowledge protocols are suitable for this purpose. Maxwell’s proof of liabilities is the first cryptography-based method to verify the user assets. It makes use of binary Merkle hash trees for representing the proof of liabilities. The root node reveals the total assets of the exchange, which will attract the adversaries to execute an attack. Later the Dagher et al scheme, a privacy preserving proof of asset for bitcoin exchanges, was proposed. The scheme works in an interactive manner that requires the collaboration of the exchange and the user. This paper proposes an efficient non-interactive proof of assets for bitcoin exchanges. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

We focus on the Republic of Moldova, which has been plagued by endemic corruption and persistently high poverty levels since her independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The transformative power of Blockchain technology and Bitcoin are then evidenced through a dual analysis of tourism 2.0 (with a real-world case study) and e-governance, which can contribute to increased inward capital investment flows, and help fight off corruption practices. Finally, we conclude that these new technologies constitute a significant step in the right direction, in order to break away from twenty-five years of disappointing socio-economic development performance.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is expected to be an enabler of 'trust-free economic transactions', which implies a frictionless economy without uncertainty and risks. Looking at current use cases of blockchains such as the peer-to-peer payment system Bitcoin, it is striking that expectations seem to be far from reality: significant exchange rate volatility and frequently occurring fraudulent behavior in the context of Bitcoin transfers form a breeding ground for uncertainties. Recent IS research therefore acknowledged that trust-freeness should be interpreted as the shift from trust to persons or institutions to trust in the technological code of the blockchain. This paper explores this trust relationship by applying an explorative research approach yielding a two-sided trust framework model. The model illustrates, how factors foster or impede the formation of trust in blockchains based on a user perspective and given a particular use case scenario, which provides a first step towards a holistic trust framework model. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.},

Information pertaining to the amount of compensation awarded to different individuals is often considered sensitive, commanding a certain degree of privacy. As Bitcoin and similarly designed cryptocurrencies evolve into a recognized medium of exchange for larger swaths of the world economy, an increasing number of people will earn income in the form of blockchain-based payments. The nature of these transactions is such that the minute details of an affected individuals compensation package and spending habits will be exposed to public scrutiny. In some cases this violates cultural norms which respect the confidentiality of salaries, yet in other cases it could be regarded as providing the benefits associated with greater transparency. In this work we analyse the Bitcoin blockchain record of periodic payments accruing to an individual address in exchange for goods or services rendered. For differing levels of available information we seek to determine the extent of insights that can be gleaned about the transacting counter-parties and the privacy implications this entails. © 2017 IEEE.},

Indeed, over the past 8 years equity market bubble of 2014-2015, real estate bubbles of 2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2015-2017 and bitcoin market bubble of 2016 were in the spotlight. Upon close analysis it is found that the bubbles were provoked by the policy of the authorities. The formation of a bubble forces regulators to implement restrictive measures, but at the same time the authorities stimulate the emergence of a rush demand on another market. Investors' funds flow into another market, which leads to the formation of a new bubble. Maintenance of markets in overheating condition is a very atypical policy. It is necessary to clarify what mechanisms are used by the Chinese authorities for markers's overheating and cooling. It is also important to understand the goals of such a policy in order to analize China's economy and to make predictions of further PRC development. It is illustrated in this article that the main reason to push the authorities to create conditions for bubble emergence is the necessity to stimulate private consumption. In China, there is a historically determined problem of the abnormally high propensity to save. The creation of bubbles is an attempt to overcome population habits, an effort to "accustom" the Chinese not to put all the money into a deposit or "under the mattress". Investing part of the funds in investment goods with almost guaranteed high yield, the Chinese receive additional income, and, as statistics show, they increase consumption.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptographic currency system. Since its introduction in 2008, Bitcoin has gained noticeable popularity, mostly due to its following properties: (1) the transaction fees are very low, and (2) it is not controlled by any central authority, which in particular means that nobody can "print" the money to generate inflation. Moreover, the transaction syntax allows to create the so-called contracts, where a number of mutually-distrusting parties engage in a protocol to jointly perform some financial task, and the fairness of this process is guaranteed by the properties of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin contracts have several potential applications in the digital economy, so far they have not been widely used in real life. This is partly due to the fact that they are cumbersome to create and analyze, and hence risky to use. In this paper we propose to remedy this problem by using the methods originally developed for the computer-aided analysis for hardware and software systems, in particular those based on the timed automata. More concretely, we propose a framework for modeling the Bitcoin contracts using the timed automata in the Uppaal model checker. Our method is general and can be used to model several contracts. As a proof-of-concept we use this framework to model some of the Bitcoin contracts from our recent previous work. We then automatically verify their security in Uppaal, finding (and correcting) some subtle errors that were difficult to spot by the manual analysis. We hope that our work can draw the attention of the researchers working on formal modeling to the problem of the Bitcoin contract verification, and spark off more research on this topic. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The fundamental re-organization of the world monetary and financial system, currently based on the US dollar, is necessary prerequisite for creating conditions for stable, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy. Using the method of scenario analysis, the authors consider four possible options for long-term development of the world monetary and financial system. Their implementation depends on prevailing expectations in the society regarding the strengthening or weakening of regulation of monetary relations, the concentration or dispersion of control over monetary authorities. The first scenario "supranational money" involves the introduction of a global reserve currency operated beyond the jurisdiction of any particular country. This scenario is based on the transformation of the IMF into a bank of central banks, conversion of SDRs into a systemic standard of value, introduction of symmetric rights and obligations between creditors and debtors to finance payment imbalances, transition to real rather than nominal fixed exchange rates, re-direction of virtual capital flows to priority service of real sector of the economy, creating a liquid market for SDR-denominated bonds. The analysis of viability of "gold re-monetization" scenario stems from comparison of the views of leading American economists on the prospects of restoring various forms of the gold standard - from the classical one with reestablishing of the monetary functions of gold to the quasi-golden variant realized through a 100% bank reserve system. In "monetary polycentrism" scenario the attention is drawn to the fact that introduction of the Euro failed to ensure financial sovereignty of the member countries of the Eurozone and to prevent economic de stabilization of the European economic and monetary union. It is emphasized that the federalization of Europe in the banking, budgetary, fiscal and political spheres as well as intensive internationalization of Renminbi could serve as the basis for creating real alternatives to US dollar hegemony in the world, followed by the formation of currency blocks in Eurasia with the participation of Russia and China. In "digital currency" scenario the authors develop the hypothesis of using crypto currency (bitcoin and its analogues) for expanding the virtual market space in order to form a global financial cybernetic system that is not controlled by state organizations and transnational corporations. The authors come to the conclusion that Russia needs to seriously prepare for implementation of all analyzed scenarios while relying on its own historic experience in creating alternative international trading and monetary system. © 2018 Nauka Publishing House.

This work opens up space for discussion about the activities of the distributed peer-to-peer network of so-called 'miners' that ensure the security of the Bitcoin network and regulate the supply of new currency in the Bitcoin economy. The physical part of the work (the heater itself) is set within a fictional near-future reality. In this reality, Bitcoin has become central to our financial service industry, and 'mining' in domestic settings is promoted by the government, as a means of heating our homes and to ensure security of the network. A 'story world' is constructed using devices such as promotional materials from the UK Government's Ministry of Crypto Currency; technical specifications; customer testimonials; and the heater itself. The main element of the exhibit is a fully working Crypto Heater prototype. This device is (in the fictional world, and the real world) part of the distributed network of Bitcoin miners. Through computation, it converts electrical energy into cryptographic currency. Uniquely Crypto Heater dissipates the heat energy (a by-product of the computational effort required to be a Bitcoin miner) through a standard household radiator. By offsetting the value of the cryptographic currency produced, against the cost of electricity used, the heater provide subsidized domestic heating.},
