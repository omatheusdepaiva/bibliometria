Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses the nexus among the Google Trends and six cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, New Economy Movement (NEM), Dash, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin by utilizing the causality-in-quantiles technique on data comprised of the years January 2016–March 2021. Findings: The findings show that Google Trends cause the Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and NEM prices at majority of the quantiles except for Dash. Originality/value: The findings will help investors to develop more in-depth understanding of impact of Google Trends on cryptocurrency prices and build successful trading strategies in a more matured digital assets ecosystem. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Dash; Ethereum; Google Trends; Litecoin; NEM; Nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test; Ripple","","","","","","","","Aalborg H.A., Molnar P., de Vries J.E., What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin?, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 255-265, (2019); Abraham J., Higdon D., Nelson J., Ibarra J., Cryptocurrency price prediction using tweet volumes and sentiment analysis, SMU Data Science Review, 1, 3, (2018); Aharon D.Y., Demir E., Lau C.K.M., Zaremba A., Twitter-Based uncertainty and cryptocurrency returns, Research in International Business and Finance, 59, (2022); Alonso-Monsalve S., Suarez-Cetrulo A.L., Cervantes A., Quintana D., Convolution on neural networks for high-frequency trend prediction of cryptocurrency exchange rates using technical indicators, Expert Systems with Applications, 149, (2020); Andrews D.W.K., Tests for parameter instability and structural change with unknown change point, Econometrica, 61, pp. 821-856, (1993); Andrews D., Ploberger W., Optimal tests when a nuisance parameter is present only under the alternative, Econometrica, 62, pp. 1383-1414, (1994); Arezooji D.M., A Big Data Analysis of the Ethereum Network: From Blockchain to Google Trends, (2021); Arratia A., Lopez-Barrantes A.X., Do google trends forecast bitcoins? stylized facts and statistical evidence, Journal of Banking and Financial Technology, 5, pp. 45-57, (2021); Aslan A., Sensoy A., Intraday efficiency-frequency nexus in the cryptocurrency markets, Finance Research Letters, 35, (2020); Aslanidis N., Bariviera A., Lopez O.G., The link between cryptocurrencies and Google Trends attention, Finance Research Letters, (2022); Balcilar M., Bekiros S., Gupta R., The role of news-based uncertainty indices in predicting oil markets: a hybrid nonparametric quantile causality method, Empirical Economics, 53, pp. 879-889, (2016); Bleher J., Dimpfl T., Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know: on the predictability of cryptocurrencies by means of Google search volume, International Review of Financial Analysis, 63, pp. 147-159, (2019); Bouoiyour J., Selmi R., Bitcoin Price: Is it Really that New Round of Volatility Can Be on Way?, (2015); Bouri E., Das M., Gupta R., Roubaud D., Spillovers between Bitcoin and other assets during bear and bull markets, Applied Economics, 50, 55, pp. 5935-5949, (2018); Brock W., Scheinkman J.A., Dechert W.D., LeBaron B., A test for independence based on the correlation dimension, Econometric Reviews, 15, pp. 197-235, (1996); Cai Z., Liu A.F., Lim E.T., Tan C.W., Zheng Z., Unraveling the effects of Google search on volatility of cryptocurrencies, Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), (2018); Cavalli S., Amoretti M., CNN-based multivariate data analysis for bitcoin trend prediction, Applied Soft Computing, 101, (2021); Cheng H.P., Yen K.C., Can the Global Economy Activity Predict Cryptocurrency Returns, (2019); Corbet S., Lucey B., Yarovaya L., Datestamping the bitcoin and ethereum bubbles, Finance Research Letters, 26, pp. 81-88, (2018); Corbet S., Larkin C., Lucey B., Meegan A., Yarovaya L., Cryptocurrency reaction to FOMC announcements: evidence of heterogeneity based on blockchain stack position, Journal of Financial Stability, (2019); Corbet S., Larkin C., Lucey B., Meegan A., Yarovaya L., The impact of macroeconomic news on Bitcoin returns, The European Journal of Finance, (2020); Corbet S., Katsiampa P., Lau C.K.M., Measuring quantile dependence and testing directional predictability between Bitcoin, altcoins and traditional financial assets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 71, (2020); Dastgir S., Demir E., Downing G., Gozgor G., Lau C.K.M., The causal relationship between Bitcoin attention and Bitcoin returns: evidence from the Copula-based Granger causality test, Finance Research Letters, 28, pp. 160-164, (2019); Demir E., Simonyan S., Garcia-Gomez C.D., Lau C.K.M., The asymmetric effect of bitcoin on altcoins: evidence from the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model, Finance Research Letters, 40, (2020); Dickey D.A., Fuller W.A., Distribution of the estimators for autoregressive time series with a unit root, Journal of the American Statistical Society, 75, pp. 427-431, (1979); Donadelli M., Gerotto L., Non-macro-based Google searches, uncertainty, and real economic activity, Research in International Business and Finance, 48, pp. 111-142, (2019); Dourado E., Brito J., Cryptocurrency.

However, it has been shown that a single Byzantine robot (such as a malfunctioning or malicious robot) can disrupt the coordination strategy of the entire swarm. Therefore, a versatile swarm robotics framework that addresses security issues in inter-robot communication and coordination is urgently needed. Here, we show that security issues can be addressed by setting up a token economy between the robots. To create and maintain the token economy, we used blockchain technology, originally developed for the digital currency Bitcoin. The robots were given crypto tokens that allowed them to participate in the swarm’s security-critical activities. The token economy was regulated via a smart contract that decided how to distribute crypto tokens among the robots depending on their contributions. We designed the smart contract so that Byzantine robots soon ran out of crypto tokens and could therefore no longer influence the rest of the swarm. In experiments with up to 24 physical robots, we demonstrated that our smart contract approach worked: The robots could maintain blockchain networks, and a blockchain-based token economy could be used to neutralize the destructive actions of Byzantine robots in a collective-sensing scenario. In experiments with more than 100 simulated robots, we studied the scalability and long-term behavior of our approach. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility and viability of blockchain-based swarm robotics.

Currency market fluctuations significantly impact the global economy, gaining increasing attention worldwide. This study focused on the US dollar as a key currency, gold as a safe asset, and bitcoin as a virtual currency, which all have great value in money and assets. This study aims to model flow fluctuations among the US Dollar, gold, and bitcoin. The research objective is to analyze the interaction effects of the US Dollar, gold, and bitcoin through the volatility modeling. This study utilized two-way ANOVA to analyze the trend of market fluctuations in the US dollars, gold, and bitcoin and whether the fluctuations in their market price affect their interaction with each other using a research model for flow fluctuations. The study examined the market price fluctuation rate of the US dollar, gold, and bitcoin by setting dependent and independent variables for the interaction analysis. The between-subjects test effects revealed that in all three cases, the main effect and the interaction effect of the two variables appear. The points appear irregularly in the profile plots in all three cases, indicating a significant interactive effect. The study’s findings show that the market price fluctuation rates of the US dollar, gold, and bitcoin interact and influence each other, implying the need for further studies on flow fluctuations analysis of the US dollar, gold, and bitcoin to this underexplored concept in global economy trend research. © 2025, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

The most popular asset prices and indices include gold, oil, the SET50 index, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Dashcoin (DASH), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Binance coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). We find a significant correlation between cryptocurrencies and the digital economy using a matrix approach to the Pearson correlation coefficient. With the help of a minimal spanning tree model and random matrix theory, we can determine the shortest route between assets. Yet, as predicted, only a small percentage of the greatest eigenvalues diverge. We are also developing a novel technique to find the SET-50 index. In an investment portfolio during the coronavirus period, alternatives to the gold price and the DOGE may offer possibilities for risk diversification. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The global world has faced out COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and now the Russian-Ukraine geopolitical crisis. This study investigates the nexus among commodities, crypto, and G20 capital markets along with risk and returns implications. To examine the impact, we applied the TVP-VAR technique suggested by Koop and Korobilis (2014), and Antonakakis, Chatziantoniou, and Gabauer (2020) by adjusting the framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). The research findings reveal that a high level of connectedness was observed during Covid-19, which was persistent for a long period and has multidimensional impacts. More particularly, EU, Canada, France Germany, and the UK were the principal supplier of spillovers to other commodities, Bitcoin, and the remaining markets. During Geopolitical Crisis (here after GPC), conclusively it is observed that of USA, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Mexico, China, Indonesia, and Japan are the net receivers of the volatility spillovers and Russia, Germany, France, European Union, Italy, UK, Argentina, India, Australia, Turkey, Korea, and South Africa are the net transmitters of volatility spillovers. Interestingly, among net transmitters Argentina, South Africa and Turkey are suffered from high inflation and substantial budget deficits, considered as weak economies of G20. Portfolio weights has been increased dramatically during COVID-19 and Russian-Ukraine war. This research could be utilized to take investment, hedging, and diversification decisions about commodities, cryptocurrencies, and stocks, particularly in such turmoil situations with the help of connectedness and various hedging techniques. © 2023 The Authors","Bitcoin; Connectedness; COVID-19; G20; Russian-Ukraine war; TVP-VAR","","","","","","","","Abuzayed B., Bouri E., Al-Fayoumi N., Jalkh N., Systemic risk spillover across global and country stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, Economic Analysis and Policy, 71, pp. 180-197, (2021); Adekoya O.B., Oliyide J.A., How COVID-19 drives connectedness among commodity and financial markets: Evidence from TVP-VAR and causality-in-quantiles techniques, Resources Policy, 70, (2021); Adekoya O.B., Oliyide J.A., Yaya O.S., Al-Faryan M.A.S., Does oil connect differently with prominent assets during war?

Bitcoin operates on blockchain technology, and its value is not a determinant of the value of a tangible asset, an organisation, or a country’s economy. Instead, it relies on an encryption technique that allows tracking of all transactions. Globally, over $2 trillion has been generated through cryptocurrency trading. Due to these financial prospects, the youths in Nigeria have cashed in on this virtual currency to create employment and wealth. This research investigates the adoption and sustainability of bitcoin and blockchain in Nigeria. A survey method with a non-probability purposive sampling technique and a homogeneous approach was employed to collect 320 responses via an online survey. Descriptive and correlational analysis in IBM SPSS version 25 was used to analyse the collected data. According to the findings, bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, with 97.5% acceptance, and is expected to be the leading virtual currency in the next five years. The research findings will help researchers and authorities comprehend the need for cryptocurrency adoption, leading to its sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","Adoption; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Fintech; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Cruz J.P.M., The bitcoin network as a platform for role-based access control and electronic voting: Using blockchain-based technology to create innovative systems, .

Daily data covering the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods were employed, using the linear and nonlinear Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models. The empirical evidence supports gold as an undisputable diversifier for equity investments in the G7 equity markets under all market conditions. Cryptocurrencies have a valuable safe-haven potential, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, the suitability of the optimal hedge asset depends on market conditions and individual countries, where the traditional assets present the best hedge in the normal conditions, compared to the modern assets. However, in the stress periods, Bitcoin presents the best hedge for the stocks of the G7 European and the UK countries, although Ethereum is the optimal hedge for the U.S. and Canada. In contrast, oil exhibits a superiority in hedging Japanese equities during all market conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 crisis; Cryptocurrencies; Hedging; Multivariate GARCH; Oil and gold","","","","","","","","Abid I., Dhaoui A., Goutte S., Guesmi K., Hedging and diversification across commodity assets, Appl.

Hedge and safe haven properties of gold-backed cryptocurrencies are also compared with those of gold and Bitcoin. For the analyses, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) and quantile coherency techniques are applied to daily data from February 2020 to March 2023. The results show that Tether Gold and PAX Gold are strong safe havens against the US and equity-valuation-related financial stress but weak safe havens against global financial stress. Tether Gold is a weak safe haven against credit-related financial stress as well. Tether Gold is a strong hedge against US financial stress but a weak hedge against aggregate financial stress of developed economies and that of emerging economies. In our sample, gold-backed cryptocurrencies usually outperform gold and Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven against financial stresses. The Quantile coherency analysis shows that Tether Gold is a hedge against low to moderate financial stress and a safe haven against extreme financial stresses. These findings have important implications for investors, risk-managers and policy makers. © 2023","Bitcoin; DCC; Financial stress; Gold; Gold-backed crypto; Quantile coherency","","","","","","","","Aharon D.Y., Ali S., Naved M., Too big to fail: The aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse and its impact on financial markets, Research in International Business and Finance, 66, (2023); Akhtaruzzaman M., Boubaker S., Lucey B.M., Sensoy A., Is gold a hedge or a safe-haven asset in the COVID–19 crisis?, Economic Modelling, 102, (2021); Akhtaruzzaman M., Boubaker S., Sensoy A., Financial contagion during COVID–19 crisis, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Ali F., Bouri E., Naifar N., Shahzad S.J.H., AlAhmad M., An examination of whether gold-backed Islamic cryptocurrencies are safe havens for international Islamic equity markets, Research in International Business and Finance, 63, (2022); Al-Nassar N.S., Boubaker S., Chaibi A., Makram B., In search of hedges and safe havens during the COVID-19 pandemic: Gold versus bitcoin, oil, and oil uncertainty, The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 90, pp. 318-332, (2022); Aloui C., Ben Hamida H., Yarovaya L., Are Islamic gold-backed cryptocurrencies different?, Finance Research Letters, 39, (2021); Ang A., Chen J., Asymmetric correlations of equity portfolios, Journal of Financial Economics, 63, 3, pp. 443-494, (2002); Barunik J., Kley T., Quantile coherency: A general measure for dependence between cyclical economic variables, The Econometrics Journal, 22, 2, pp. 131-152, (2019); Baumohl E., Shahzad S.J.H., Quantile coherency networks of international stock markets, Finance Research Letters, 31, pp. 119-129, (2019); Baur D.G., Hoang L., The bitcoin gold correlation puzzle, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 32, (2021); Baur D.G., Lucey B.M., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

We investigate long and short-run effects of global EPU on the returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance coin and Ripple, along with ascertaining asymmetries, through the NARDL (Non-Linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model, for the period ranging from September 2017 to August 2022. In the long run, except for Tether, all other cryptocurrencies are negatively affected by EPU, challenging the safe hedge properties of cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance coin and Ripple display positive relations with growing EPU in short run, reflecting their safe haven attributes over a shorter horizon. Additionally, these cryptocurrencies exhibit asymmetries in the short run. Further, we analyse the effect of US, Chinese and Indian EPU on bitcoin returns to understand the effect of EPU shocks of advanced and emerging economies. US EPU has long-run negative effects on bitcoin market, whereas Indian and Chinese EPU have no significant impact in long term. Moreover, our analysis also establishes the detrimental impact of the Indian government's crypto tax policy on bitcoin. The study has relevance for current and potential investors of the cryptocurrency market apart from the policymakers and regulatory bodies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetry; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; EPU; NARDL; Safe haven","","","","","","","","Aboura S., A note on the bitcoin and fed funds rate, Empirical Economics, 63, 5, pp. 2577-2603, (2022); Aharon D.Y., Demir E., Lau C.K.M., Zaremba A., Twitter-Based uncertainty and cryptocurrency returns, Research in International Business and Finance, 59, (2022); Bahmani-Oskooee M., Maki Nayeri M., Policy uncertainty and consumption in G7 countries: An asymmetry analysis, International Economics, 163, pp. 101-113, (2020); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Banerjee A., Dolado J., Mestre R., Error-correction mechanism tests for cointegration in a single-equation framework, Journal of Time Series Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 267-283, (1998); Batabyal S., Killins R., Economic policy uncertainty and stock market returns: Evidence from Canada, The Journal of Economic Asymmetries, 24, (2021); Beckers S., Do social media trump news?

Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being adopted as a means of transaction and ownership in the digital domain, particularly in areas like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens. Known for its high volatility, this market offers investors the potential for higher returns than traditional financial markets like stocks, foreign exchange, and commodities. However, it remains underexplored in academic research. In this paper, we propose the use of social network analysis to effectively model and analyze the cryptocurrency market and conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore its key properties, including correlation structure, topological characteristics, stability, and influence. Furthermore, we propose the use of centrality measures as novel indicators to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price movement predictions. Our research introduces a novel method for understanding and navigating the cryptocurrency market, enabling investors to integrate advanced analytical tools into their decision-making processes.  © 2013 IEEE.","Centrality measures; cryptocurrency; price movement prediction; social network analysis","Bitcoin; Costs; Decision making; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Motion estimation; Topology; Centrality measures; Correlation; Large financial markets; Market capitalization; Movement prediction; Price movement; Price movement prediction; Property; Social Network Analysis; Social networking (online); Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Marti G., Nielsen F., Binkowski M., Donnat P., A review of two decades of correlations, hierarchies, networks and clustering in financial markets, Progress in Information Geometry: Theory and Applications., pp. 245-274, (2021); Zhou P.-Y., Chan K.C.C., Ou C.X., Corporate communication network and stock price movements: Insights from data mining, IEEE Trans.

The consensus algorithm plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of blockchain systems. The ongoing expansion of the digital economy presents a persistent challenge in identifying or constructing an optimal blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithm that effectively addresses specific business requirements especially for various applications of consumer electronics. This research study introduces a novel approach to enhance blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithms, prioritizing the augmentation of throughput, leader's capacity, and enhancement of fault tolerance. The solution under consideration employs committees established by the Louvain Modularity Optimization (LMO) algorithm for local blockchain, along with reputation-based leader selection, to safeguard the integrity of the blockchain network globally. The proposed approach distributes the transactions among the committees and demonstrates an average throughput that is about 1.6 times greater than that of RapidChain following 100 iterations and 1.14 times more than that of the sharding technique. The results indicate that the utilization of reputation-based leader selection and immediate leader replacement, which is based on reputation score, effectively enhances the resilience of the system against attacks, while simultaneously boosting the overall throughput.  © 2024 IEEE.","Blockchain; consensus algorithm; hybrid consensus; Louvain modularity optimization; reputation-based leader selection","Bitcoin; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Fault tolerance; Peer to peer networks; Throughput; Block-chain; Consensus algorithms; Fault- tolerant systems; Hybrid consensus; Louvain modularity optimization; Optimisations; Peer-to-peer computing; Reputation-based leader selection; Blockchain","","","","","","","Swan M., Blockchain: Blueprint for A New Economy, (2015); Tandon R., Verma A., Gupta P., D-BLAC: A dual blockchainbased decentralized architecture for authentication and communication in VANET, Expert Syst.

Furthermore, social media has garnered attention for its predictive capabilities in various fields, including financial markets and the economy. In this study, we exploit the predictive power of sentiment from Twitter and Reddit, alongside Google Trends indexes, to forecast log returns for 10 cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Litecoin, Enjin Coin, Horizen, Namecoin, Peercoin and Feathercoin. We evaluate the performance of LASSO Vector Autoregression using daily data from January 2018 to January 2022. In a 30-day recursive forecast, we achieve a mean directional accuracy (MDA) rate of over 50%. Moreover, we observe a significant increase in forecast accuracy in terms of MDA when using sentiment and attention variables as predictors, but only for less capitalized cryptocurrencies. This improvement is not reflected in the RMSE. We also conduct a Granger causality test using post-double LASSO selection for high-dimensional VAR models.

However, their high volatility, erratic price fluctuations, and tendency to exhibit price bubbles have made investors cautious about investing in them. Consequently, it is essential to develop methods and models to forecast cryptocurrency returns to benefit investors, traders, and the scientific community. Despite the considerable volume of research on Bitcoin price forecasting, other cryptocurrencies have received little attention in academic literature. Additionally, the current body of literature on predicting cryptocurrency prices or returns emphasizes the use of in-sample methodologies. However, this method is susceptible to overfitting. To address these gaps in the literature, this study employs autoregressive moving average (ARMA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH), and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning neural networks to forecast returns for the ten most actively traded digital currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash, Tether, and Binance Coin. To assess the accuracy of the two models, this study utilizes an out-of-sample method with data gathered sequentially from November 9, 2017, to September 18, 2022. The results indicate that all models exhibit high accuracy, as evidenced by their low root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) values. Meanwhile, the hybrid EGARCH-LSTM or GARCH-LSTM models demonstrate slightly better accuracy compared with the other models. The findings are valuable for investors, traders, and researchers involved in cryptocurrency forecasting. © 2024 The Author(s)","ARMA; Cryptocurrency; Deep learning, LSTM; Machine learning; Time-series forecasting","","","","","","UPAR;

The authors focus on the most used and owned cryptocurrencies that cover Europe, the US and Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach: An autoregressive distributed lag panel (pooled mean group and mean group) is utilized, and a robustness check is incorporated by using a Random Effect Model and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Findings: Four new findings were discovered, including (1) the vaccine confidence index (VCI) pushes economic recovery and increased demand for the Bitcoin market, but the opposite result was interestingly observed from Ethereum; (2) the blockchain features were revealed to be essential to Bitcoin, while they were irrelevant to Ethereum for short-run country-specific results; (3) the hash rate and network difficulty moved inversely during the pandemic; and (4) the government played a significant role in taking action during uncertain times and regarding cryptocurrency policies. Research limitations/implications: VCI is constructed by the most used vaccine type in our sample countries (i.e. Pfizer), as the data for a specific classification by each type is still unavailable. Practical implications: Providing an evenly distributed vaccination program primary vaccination series against COVID-19 to the citizens is an essential duty of the government. Bitcoin policymakers and investors should watch the COVID-19 vaccine distributions closely as it will affect its return. Ethereum is emphasized to keep developing its smart contract which appeared to outplay other blockchain features. Cryptocurrency investors should be wise in their investment decisions by analysing the news thoroughly. Social implications: This research emphasizes that the success in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination requires citizens' willingness to participate and their trust in the vaccine's efficacy. Such self-awareness and self-discipline in society can ultimately empower individuals and stabilise the economy. Nevertheless, the implementation of health protocols is still highly required to prevent the spread of new variants of COVID-19.

The study aims at identifying the causal relationships among these energy transition metals and other major assets like oil, gold, and bitcoin, and how they shape Chile's economy, both pre-COVID-19 and during the first months of the pandemic. Our Structural Vector Autoregressive analysis is carried out with daily frequency data for two separate periods, the pre-COVID-19 analysis (the whole of 2018) and the COVID-19 analysis (Feb 2020 to end of 2020). Our results suggest that Chile has been highly responsive to renewable energy shocks during COVID-19, in concert with an increased responsiveness to traditional oil-driven shocks. This lends weight to the idea that traditional energies are still relevant and concomitant with energy transition, especially in a small open resource-oriented economy like Chile. In addition to that, bitcoin shocks seem to have contributed to Chile's transition, likely as a result of bitcoin's extensive use of energy and its potential to increase renewable energy capacity. Policywise, our findings call for a watchful eye on regulatory constraints, excessively high royalties, and the maintenance of stabilization funds to mitigate uncertainty, all of which can affect Chile's competitive edge at an untimely hour. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Copper; COVID-19; Lithium; SVAR","Chile; Bitcoin; Copper; Lithium; Autoregressive analysis; Causal relationships; Energy; Energy transitions; Frequency data; Renewable energies; Renewable energy capacity; Spillover effects; Stabilization Fund; SVAR; copper; COVID-19; lithium; spillover effect; time series analysis; transition element; COVID-19","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","The authors are grateful for the valuable comments from the Editor, Richard S.J.

Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University, Almaty, 050000, Kazakhstan","Background: Bitcoin mining, an energy-intensive process, requires significant amounts of electricity, which results in a particularly high carbon footprint from mining operations. In the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a substantial portion of electricity is generated from coal-fired power plants, the carbon footprint of mining operations is particularly high. This article examines the scale of energy consumption by mining farms, assesses their share in the country’s total electricity consumption, and analyzes the carbon footprint associated with bitcoin mining. A comparative analysis with other sectors of the economy, including transportation and industry is provided, along with possible measures to reduce the environmental impact of mining operations. Materials and methods: To assess the impact of bitcoin mining on the carbon footprint in Kazakhstan, electricity consumption from 2016 to 2023, provided by the Bureau of National Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, was used. Data on electricity production from various types of power plants was also analyzed. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used to analyze the environmental performance of energy systems. CO2 emissions were estimated based on emission factors for various energy sources. Results: The total electricity consumption in Kazakhstan increased from 74,502 GWh in 2016 to 115,067.6 GWh in 2023. The industrial sector’s electricity consumption remained relatively stable over this period. The consumption by mining farms amounted to 10,346 GWh in 2021. A comparative analysis of CO2 emissions showed that bitcoin mining has a higher carbon footprint compared to electricity generation from renewable sources, as well as oil refining and car manufacturing. Conclusions: Bitcoin mining has a significant negative impact on the environment of the Republic of Kazakhstan due to high electricity consumption and resulting carbon dioxide emissions. Measures are needed to transition to sustainable energy sources and improve energy efficiency to reduce the environmental footprint of cryptocurrency mining activities. © 2024 by author(s).","bitcoin mining; carbon footprint; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; electricity; Kazakhstan; sustainable development","","","","","","Universitas Islam Riau, UIR","Thank you, Universitas Islam Riau (UIR), for supporting this article until it is published.","Bureau of National Statistics KZ; Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index; Chamanara S., Ghaffarizadeh S.

The identification of fraudulent transactions is a crucial task within the financial system. However, existing detection methods predominantly rely on either an individual model or a single bagging or boosting ensemble model, leading to inadequate prediction accuracy and limited interpretability. To address this limitation, a hybrid ensemble model that integrates bagging (random forest (RF)) and boosting (categorical boosting (CatBoost)) is proposed, in which strong classifiers -CatBoost is used to replace the weak classifiers in RF, thus effectively improving the prediction performance. Empirical findings demonstrate the proposed hybrid ensemble framework can consistently yields the highest accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce extreme gradient boosting as a surrogate model that can obtain more accurate relations between actual labels and the predictions, compensating for the challenges of understanding complex models. Then, the visualization package based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) value is adopted for the interpretability analysis on the surrogate model, which contributes to the field of fraud detection by revealing the potential influencing factors behind the predicted results and providing unique insights into how fraud detection behavior can be detected. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin fraud detection; Hybrid ensemble model; Interpretability analysis","Bitcoin fraud detection; Block-chain; Ensemble models; Fraud detection; Fraudulent transactions; Hybrid ensemble model; Interpretability; Interpretability analyze; Random forests; Surrogate modeling","","","","","Naïve Bayes; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (24YJC630294); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, NUPT, (NYY223024); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, NUPT; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72201054); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: In response to the growing threat, financial institutions have made concerted efforts to enhance security measures and implement fraud detection systems (Bolton and Hand, 2002). Initially, automated fraud detection relied on the expertise of domain professionals to develop a set of discriminative rules (Leonard, 1995). Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) techniques has gained prominence in identifying fraudulent patterns within transaction logs of financial organizations (Xu et al., 2023). ML methods encompass both supervised learning techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM), Na\u00EFve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), neural network, and decision tree (DT), as well as unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., isolation forest and K-means). Unsupervised learning techniques might be sensitive to outliers and noise in the data, compromising their ability to accurately identify fraudulent patterns amidst legitimate transactions. Supervised learning approaches outperforming unsupervised approaches through the availability of labeled observations have gained widespread adoption (Al-Hashedi and Magalingam, 2021; Fiore et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b). The current landscape of supervised learning techniques predominantly relies on individual prediction models. However, individual models, such as SVM, NB, and DT possess their own inherent limitations. SVM is sensitivity to the choice of kernel function and parameters, which can significantly affect its performance and scalability in handling high-dimensional and complex transaction data. The assumption of feature independence in NB may not hold true for complex and interconnected features present in Bitcoin transaction data. DT tend to overfit noisy data and struggle with capturing complex relationships among features, potentially leading to reduced accuracy in detecting sophisticated fraud patterns. Thus, individual prediction models cannot meet the stringent requirements of financial institutions in terms of accuracy when confronted with Bitcoin fraudulent data exhibiting significant structural and characteristic variation (Kim and Upneja, 2021).This research was supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 24YJC630294), the Talent Introduction Research Start-up Fund Project of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (Grant No. NYY223024), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72201054).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 24YJC630294), the Talent Introduction Research Start-up Fund Project of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (Grant No. NYY223024), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72201054).","Abdallah A., Maarof M.A., Zainal A., Fraud detection system: a survey, J.

This paper examines the relationship between right-wing populism and Bitcoin. Through textual and visual analyses, the paper shows how Bukele weaves the promises and techno-utopian ideology surrounding Bitcoin into classic populist narratives. Adopting Bitcoin adds the promise of technology-driven development and the realization of a techno-utopia to the populist narrative template, allowing Bukele to construct a populist myth of himself as a tech-savvy visionary. This brand of crypto-populism represents a novel addition to the right-wing populist repertoire, capitalizing on the promises of an ongoing digital revolution. © 2024 The Author(s).

In this article, we explore the impact of the pandemic on the weak-form efficiency of the cryptocurrency and forex markets by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two markets. To estimate the weak-form of market efficiency, we utilize the asymmetric market deficiency measure (MDM) derived using the asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach, along with fuzzy entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Fisher information. Initially, we analyze the temporal evolution of these four measures using overlapping sliding windows. Subsequently, we assess both the mean value and variance of the distribution for each measure and currency in two distinct time periods: before and during the pandemic. Our findings reveal distinct shifts in efficiency before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, there was a clear increase in the weak-form inefficiency of traditional currencies during the pandemic. Among cryptocurrencies, BTC stands out for its behavior, which resembles that of traditional currencies. Moreover, our results underscore the significant impact of COVID-19 on weak-form market efficiency during both upward and downward market movements. These findings could be useful for investors, portfolio managers, and policy makers. © 2023 by the authors.","Bitcoin; complex systems; complexity; COVID-19; cryptocurrencies; econophysics; entropy; forex market; market efficiency; multifractal analysis","","","","","","","","Bachelier L., Théorie de la Speculation, Annales Scientifiques de I.E.N.S, 3, pp. 21-86, (1990); Fama E.F., Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, J.

Design/methodology/approach: Using the monthly data from January 2013 to April 2023, the paper analyses the response of Cryptocurrencies vis-à-vis gold prices to three different macroeconomic shocks, namely, the economic policy uncertainty shock, the financial uncertainty shock and the inflation shock, within a VAR framework with the help of the Generalized Impulse Response Function. Findings: Both gold and cryptocurrencies have limited hedging abilities against macroeconomic shocks across countries. In India, bitcoin has become the new digital gold, while in China, it is not bitcoin but rather gold that retains its hedging abilities. Neither bitcoin nor gold, Binance Coin or Cardano, are found to be the new digital gold in Brazil and Russia. Originality/value: The paper compares the top nine cryptocurrencies with the traditional asset gold in terms of their hedging potential against macroeconomic shocks in emerging countries. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cryptocurrencies; Financial uncertainty shock; Gold; Hedging; Inflation shock; Policy uncertainty shock","","","","","","","","Al Mamun M., Uddin G.S., Suleman M.T., Kang S.H., Geopolitical risk, uncertainty and Bitcoin investment, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 540, (2020); Al-Nassar N.S., Boubaker S., Chaibi A., Makram B., In search of hedges and safe havens during the COVID-19 pandemic: gold versus Bitcoin, oil, and oil uncertainty, The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 90, pp. 318-332, (2023); Anamika A., Chakraborty M., Subramaniam S., Does sentiment impact cryptocurrency?, Journal of Behavioral Finance, 24, 2, pp. 202-218, (2023); Bahloul S., Mroua M., Naifar N., Re-evaluating the hedge and safe-haven properties of Islamic indexes, gold and Bitcoin: evidence from DCC–GARCH and quantile models, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 14, 8, pp. 1167-1181, (2023); Bariviera A.F., Basgall M.J., Hasperue W., Naiouf M., Some stylized facts of the Bitcoin market, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 484, pp. 82-90, (2017); Baur D.G., Dimpfl T., Asymmetric volatility in cryptocurrencies, Economics Letters, 173, pp. 148-151, (2018); Baur D.G., Lucey B.M., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

Drawing on the daily data from 02 August 2019 to 17 April 2020, our key findings suggest that the contagious effects in financial assets' returns significantly increased under COVID-19, indicating exacerbated market risk. The connectedness spiked in the middle of March, consistent with lockdown timings in major economies. The effect became severe with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic, confirming negative news effects. The return connectedness suggests that COVID-19 has been a catalyst of contagious effects on the financial markets. The crude oil and the government bonds are however not as much affected by the spillovers as their endogenous innovation. In terms of spillovers, we do find the safe-haven function of Gold and Bitcoin. Comparatively, the safe-haven effectiveness of Bitcoin is unstable over the pandemic. Whereas, GOLD is the most promising hedge and safe-haven asset, as it remains robust during the current crisis of COVID-19 and thus exhibits superiority over Bitcoin and Tether. Our findings are useful for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers interested in spillovers and safe havens during the current pandemic. © 2022 The Authors.

To deal with offenders, solutions such as legislation and regulation are proposed. However, these are foreign to the P2P spirit of trusted interactions and transactions. This paper aims to identify solutions that align with P2P technologies and relationships to combat the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. In line with our research question, we adopt the method of grounded theory. Based on 45 interviews on 1,500 h of podcasts, blogs, and TV shows, we observed how experts in finance, technology, and cryptocurrency analyzed the hazards, as well as, the solutions for cryptocurrencies schemes. The results indicate that this new technology has also engendered new types of criminal schemes; thus, we can categorize malicious behaviors into conventional and P2P hazards. In addition, experts also point to conventional and P2P solutions to crypto-crimes at the individual, organizational, communal, and national levels. As such, they underscore the discrepancies between those who push for solutions favoring conventional regulatory forces versus those advocating for normative legitimacy, hence pulling the industry to preserve the P2P identity. Following institutional theory and the need for legitimacy in this new and disruptive industry, we discuss the tension between agendas and suggest unorthodox solutions for an innovative yet troubled technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Cybercrime; Cybersecurity; Institutional theory; P2P","Bitcoin; Crime; Cybersecurity; Creatives; Cyber security; Cyber-crimes; Grounded theory; Institutional theory; Malicious behavior; P2P; P2P technologies; Podcasts; Research questions; Hazards","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Market, hierarchy and trust: The knowledge economy and the future of capitalism, Organization Science, 12, 2, pp. 215-234, (2001); Akanfe O., Lawong D., Rao H.R., Blockchain technology and privacy regulation: Reviewing frictions and synthesizing opportunities, International Journal of Information Management, 76, (2024); Arli D., van Esch P., Bakpayev M., Laurence A., Do consumers really trust cryptocurrencies?, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 39, 1, pp. 74-90, (2021); Assadi D., Lorunser B., Strategic management analysis of al Qaeda.

We introduce a basic taxonomy of behavioural indicators, distinguishing between consumer confidence, economic policy uncertainty (EPU), and indicators of financial volatility. Our estimations reveal that the Bitcoin trading volume can be predicted more accurately by EPU than by any other class of indicators. Finally, we identify the COVID-19 shock as a catalyst for a psychologically-driven Bitcoin market and find evidence that Bitcoin was a macro hedging instrument in the pandemic. To obtain our results, we conducted a panel Granger-causality test, employing the Least Squares Dummy Variables (LSDV) estimator. Contrary to previous research, we found that market fundamentals (industrial production and equity market volume) became significant drivers of Bitcoin trading during the pandemic. This conclusion was preserved when we used the LSDV corrected estimator, which is more suitable for panels with a smaller time dimension. Apart from the practical implications for traders, this paper provides researchers with detailed steps for applying Granger causality testing in panel data settings. © 2023 Croatian Operational Research Society.","Bitcoin; economic policy uncertainty; LSDV estimator; LSDV-corrected estimator; panel Granger causality test","","","","","","Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ, (HRZZ-IP-2018-01-4189, HRZZ-IP-2019-04-7816)","This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the HRZZ-IP-2018-01-4189 and HRZZ-IP-2019-04-7816.","Al-Yahaee K.

However, unlike credit cards and other well-established digital payment services and solutions, digital currencies bring new and complex challenges for the economies, including legal and regulatory implications. Private cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have impacted the financial system primarily as a speculative trading instrument. However, with the emergence of central bank digital currencies, digital money has the potential to revolutionise the payment system, since its features can assure the stability needed for a transactional currency. In this context, tax administrations will be affected both on policy and operational aspects. In this article, we focus on the main aspects that can influence the use of cryptocurrencies and CBDCs as a payment method and investigate the consequences and possibilities of this application to the taxation processes.

This transformation has been driven by the rapid growth in computing power, storage capabilities, and data transmission infrastructures. These changes have enabled innovations, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smartphones, digitalized homes, (semi) autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and more. Digitalization has further resulted in faster, more effective service delivery by many organizations. The phenomenon of digitalization relies on an increasingly finite supply of resources, such as crude oil, silicon, and energy. Over the past 150 years, humans have consumed as many natural resources as they have consumed in the past 20,000 years. In part, this increasing clip of consumption has been driven by digitalization, as novel, technology-based solutions, such as blockchain, supplant older, slower low-tech solutions, such as books and ledgers, to process data and create value. Digitalization’s demand for resources may be leading us to an environmental abyss. Consider cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, whose electricity consumption is approximately equal to the energy needs of small nations such as Malaysia or Sweden. Such consumption evokes the question, is, “is more digitalization really better, or given the harm to the planet, is this one context where less is more?”. In this paper, we develop a research agenda for understanding the full cost of digitalization and its impact on sustainability. We do so in three parts; first, we offer a crisp definition of sustainability; second, we offer a concise review of the digitalization and sustainability literature; and third, we offer suggestions for research that advances our understanding of how digitalization impacts sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s).","Digitalization; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Green IS; Green IT; Social sustainability; Sustainability; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","Anser M.K., Yousaf Z., Zaman K., Green Technology acceptance model and green logistics operations: “to see which way the wind is blowing, Front Sustain, 1, pp. 1-9, (2020); Barnato K., What’s in your smartphone?

This study examines three main characteristics of the economy-intensive blockchain system, namely reliability, investment slopes, financial and accounting aspects that ultimately determine the confidence in the choice to invest in cryptocurrency. The analysis focuses on the study of the Bitcoin (BTC) investment slopes during January 2014–April 2023, considering the specifics of blockchain technology and the inferences of ethics, reliability and real-world data on investment Tassets in the context of conventional regulated markets. Using an econometric model that incorporates reliability analysis techniques, factorial comparisons and multinomial regression using economic crisis periods as a dummy variable, this study reveals important findings for practical and academic purposes. The results of this study show that the investment slopes of Bitcoin (BTC) are mostly predictable for downward trends, when statistically significant correlations with the investment slopes of conventional stock markets are observable. The moderate or high increase in performance slopes pose several challenges for predictive analysis, as they are influenced by other factors than conventional regulated market performance inferences. The results of this study are of intense interest to researchers and investors alike, as they demonstrate that investment slopes analysis sheds light on the intricacies of investment decisions, allowing a comprehensive assessment of both conventional markets and Bitcoin transactions. © 2023 by the authors.","Bitcoin investment; conventional markets; cryptocurrency; international finance; investment reliability; investment slopes; trust of blockchain","","","","","","","","Zubaydi H.D., Varga P., Molnar S., Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Ensuring Security and Privacy Aspects in Internet of Things: A Systematic Literature Review, Sensors, 23, (2023); Dorofeyev M., Ksov M., Ponkratov V., Masterov A., Karaev A., Vasyunina M., Trends and Prospects for the Development of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in the Digital Economy, Eur.

Moreover, when analysing risk spillovers from Bitcoin to currencies, we find that Bitcoin exercises significant power over most currencies, with the South African rand and Brazilian real holding both the highest downside and upside risk before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, respectively. When considering risk spillovers from currencies towards Bitcoin, the Japanese yen exhibits the highest downside spillovers.

This decentralization is also pivotal in payment Payment channel networks (PCNs), including the Lightning Network, have emerged as a promising solution to the scalability challenges that many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, grapple with. These PCNs, while innovative, also inherit the rigorous dependability demands of the blockchain. A pivotal aspect of this dependability is the need for a high degree of decentralization, essential for mitigating liquidity bottlenecks and on-path attacks. Driven by this imperative, our research embarks on an empirical centrality analysis of the Lightning Network, with a keen focus on the betweenness centrality distribution of its routing system. Utilizing an extensive dataset, sourced from several millions of broadcasted messages via the gossip protocol, we introduce the TimeMachine tool, an innovative method that allows for a temporal exploration of the network's evolution. Our findings reveal that while the Lightning Network exhibits a commendable level of decentralization, there is a discernible skew: a limited set of nodes command a significant portion of the transactions. Alarmingly, over the past two years, the network's centrality has surged, with the inequality, as gauged by the Gini index, rising by over 15 uptick of approximately 5 in. This research not only uncovers critical insights into the Lightning Network's structural dynamics but also raises the question about strategies and policies that ensure its sustained decentralization in the face of evolving challenges such as security vulnerabilities, potential monopolistic tendencies, liquidity bottlenecks, the risk of transaction censorship and many more. © 2023 The Authors","Betweenness centrality;

Circles was born out of the Gnosis Chain as a more democratic alternative to Bitcoin coupled with the ambitious political project of algorithmically distributing UBI. Backed by the Gnosis Chain, Circles Coop was founded in 2020 to implement this idea in Berlin. Examining the failure of the Berlin pilot helps us draw substantial conclusions with regard to the implementation of UBI on blockchain. UBI alone, on blockchain or not, is not enough to solve the problems its proponents argue against. UBI would be helpful as a tool if plugged into a model of production embedded into a political strategy aiming to fix key problems of current societies such as gaping inequalities and climate change. We give a snapshot here of the model of open cooperativism as a counter-hegemonic political project vis-à-vis neoliberalism. Circles UBI could plug into the model of open cooperativism as a distribution and liquidity injection mechanism to foster the transition towards a commons-based ethical and sustainable post-capitalist economy.

In an effort of interdisciplinary integration, combining human geography with political economy and cultural anthropology, we critically assess the linkages between cryptocurrency, economic crisis and forms of political and economic precarity and exploitation. Drawing on experiences in Latin America, mostly on the cases of El Salvador and Venezuela, we explore how cryptocurrencies have rapidly emerged and expanded during periods of economic and political crises. We ground this discussion on social theories of money and critical analysis of blockchain and cryptocurrencies that question the apolitical assumptions of these apparent “trustless” infrastructures. The article contends that cryptocurrencies have the capacity to create potential niches for makeshift economic survival, speculation and quick profit, while at the same time reproducing historical conditions of vulnerability, inequality and ‘crypto-colonialism’. Though cryptocurrencies are surrounded by stories of freedom and decentralised community control, our ethnographic data on El Salvador and Venezuela suggest they often rely on free market fundamentalism and conditions of political corruption by authoritarian state-backed elites. © The Author(s) 2023.","bitcoin; crisis; crypto-colonialism; cryptocurrency; El Salvador; Venezuela","","","","","","NWO-Veni; Independent Social Research Foundation, ISRF; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (430-2022-00402); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Antulio Rosales received funding from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant # 430-2022-00402).

Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a new asset class, and individuals and organizations often face investment decisions related to cryptocurrencies. Decision science techniques, such as risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and behavioral economics, can be applied to assess the risks and potential returns associated with cryptocurrency investments. These techniques help investors make informed decisions based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market conditions. Design/Methodology: Both citation network analysis and author co-citation analysis are used in our analysis based on Cryptocurrency articles written in 2019 from 2013 to 2022 with top titles including Current Issues in Auditing and International Review of Financial Analysis to find both keywords and track Bitcoin-related cited works. The research also uses VOS Viewer and R in the analysis to visualize both data networks and spread Findings: In our analysis, we find that Cryptocurrency, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, and Distributed Ledger Technology were the most commonly-used terms, studying Cryptocurrency in emerging nations is difficult due to significant social disparities and poor reading levels, Guglielmo Maria Caporale is the most cited author in this area with three works and 147 Citations up to the moment of our study, the most Cryptocurrency-focused institution is the Sumy State institution in Ukraine, which has produced two papers up to the moment of our study, and India gets the most publications in the area, followed by the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, and so on, and the United Arab Emirates comes in last place regarding cryptocurrency-related publications. Our study claims no consensus on defining cryptocurrency, leading authors to use varying terms, words such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and distributed ledger technology are often used equally, and cryptocurrency research has had a significant uptick over the past decade and is increasing at an impressive rate. Practical Implications: The research findings have several practical implications for cryptocurrency, specifically regarding Bitcoin patterns that benefit researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders. For instance, researchers can utilize the study's information to explore new areas and understand the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency research. Policymakers can leverage the insights to develop effective policies and initiatives, enhancing regulation, risk assessment, and consumer protection in cryptocurrency ecosystems. The research contributes to a broader understanding of cryptocurrency's dynamics, societal impact, and implications for finance, economy, and society. This knowledge aids informed decision-making for individuals, businesses, and organizations involved with cryptocurrency. Originality: Cryptocurrency citation network analysis has been used in this study. It explains why some writers are cited extensively around the globe while others are cited so rarely locally. Indications are that the worldwide citation is much greater. However, the number of local to worldwide citations is low and could be improved by prioritizing better local citations. Therefore, the study concludes that scholarly interest in cryptocurrency is new and has excellent potential for future research. © 2023 Hindawi Limited.

These three issues are complexly interlinked, with profound economic and environmental implications. In this study, we explore the correlation among these three issues and attempt to understand the influence of crude oil and Bitcoin on carbon dioxide emissions. We created a novel approach, named quantile mediation analysis, which blends mediation regression with quantile regression, enabling us to explore the influence of Brent crude oil on carbon dioxide emissions by considering the mediating impact of Bitcoin. According to the findings from using our new approach, the impact of Brent crude oil on carbon dioxide emissions is partly mediated by Bitcoin, and the association between Brent crude oil and carbon dioxide emissions involves both direct and indirect effects. Since the carbon dioxide generated by the extraction of crude oil and Bitcoin has a great impact on the environment, accelerating the use of clean energy technologies to reduce our reliance on crude oil should be the direction that the cryptocurrency industry ought to pursue in the future. © 2023 by the authors.","Brent crude (BRT); CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; cryptocurrency; nonlinear inverted U-shaped curve; renewable energy","Bitcoin; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Brent crude; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO 2 emission; Economic implications; Global economies; Global environment; Mediation analysis; Nonlinear inverted U-shaped curve; Renewable energies; U-shaped; Crude oil","","","","","","","Libecap G.D., The political economy of crude oil cartelization in the United States, 1933–1972, J.

We analyze data for the period November 15, 2017–October 28, 2022 using methodologies in Diebold and Yilmaz (Int J Forecast 28(1):57–66, 2012) and Baruník and Křehlík (J Financ Economet 16(2):271–296 2018). Our analysis shows the COVID-19 pandemic amplified volatility spillovers, thereby intensifying the impact of financial contagion between markets. This finding indicates the impact of the pandemic on the US economy heightened risk transmission across markets. Moreover, we show that Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, Apple, and Microsoft are net volatility transmitters, while Tether, BNB, Exxon Mobil, Nextera Energy, Alphabet, and Amazon are net receivers Our results suggest that short-term volatility spillovers outweigh medium- and long-term spillovers, and that investors should be more concerned about short-term repercussions because they do not have enough time to act quickly to protect themselves from market risks when the US market is affected. Furthermore, in contrast to short-term dynamics, longer term patterns display superior hedging efficiency. The net-pairwise directional spillovers show that Alphabet and Amazon are the highest shock transmitters to other companies. The findings in this study have implications for both investors and policymakers. © The Author(s) 2024.","And N70; C58; Connectedness network; Cryptocurrency; Energy companies; G10; Technology companies;

The purpose is to see to what extent BTC is mimicking the role precious metals are known for, that of being a reliable store of value. Design/methodology/approach: The author relies on vector autoregressive modeling, as it yields a very flexible framework for forecasting and interpreting the interdependencies among variables, while providing a very intuitive framework when the underlying structural model is unknown. The author performs the analysis first for the whole sample and then for a “COVID-19 subsample.” Findings: The author finds evidence supporting a stronger link between BTC and gold in COVID-19 times, with BTC the main driving force. The author quantifies the contribution of BTC to the surge in gold’s price during those early months of COVID-19 in the order of 28%, thus lending support to the idea of intrinsic or fundamental value in BTC. Practical implications: Investors might consider including BTC in their portfolios as a long-term investment, very much like they do with gold. Social implications: Cryptos at large represent an important check on the ever-expanding monetary policy pursued by central banks in recent times. Originality/value: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on the world economy. It is thus timely to reevaluate the relationship between BTC and other assets such as gold and silver, which are traditionally seen as safe havens against uncertainty. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; COVID; Gold; Hedge; VAR","","","","","","","","Arreola Hernandez J., Hasan M., Bitcoin, gold, and the VIX: short- and long-term effects of economic policy uncertainty, Applied Economics Letters, 30, 6, pp. 761-765, (2022); Balli F., de Bruin A., Chowdhury I., Naeem M., Connectedness of cryptocurrencies and prevailing uncertainties, Applied Economics Letters, 27, 16, pp. 1316-1322, (2020); Batten J.A., Choudhury T., Kinateder H., Wagner N.F., Volatility impacts on the European banking sector: GFC and COVID-19, Annals of Operations Research, pp. 1-26, (2022); Bildirici M.E., Sonustun B., Chaotic behavior in gold, silver, copper and bitcoin prices, Resources Policy, 74, (2021); (2021); Bouri E., Gupta R., Tiwari A.K., Roubaud D., Does bitcoin hedge global uncertainty?

The authors argue that current behavioral prediction models, such as TRA, TPB, and TAM, do not adequately account for the affective constructs of decision-making when high monetary stakes are involved. To address this gap, the authors propose an integrative model that accounts for financial decision-making processes, risk constructs, and population-specific behavioral strategies. The study used a quantitative-based research design and involved 684 university students from one of the major state universities in the Philippines. The findings show that perceived usefulness, attitude toward cryptocurrency, self-efficacy, and descriptive norms significantly influenced the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Overall, the study confirms the direct influence of instrumental attitude, knowledge of cryptocurrency, descriptive norm, risk tolerance, ease and difficulty, and control on an individual’s intention to use cryptocurrency. The study contributes to exploring a less studied Philippine consumer base and provides empirical findings and insights into Bitcoin adoption in developing Asian economies. JEL Classification: G15.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the newest Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to examine the conditional volatility of the stock market for Bitcoin and crude oil prices in the Asian perspective. The sample stock market includes Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Malaysian, Pakistani, Singaporean, South Korean and Turkish stock exchanges, with daily time series data ranging from 4 April 2015−31 July 2023. Findings: The outcome reveals the presence of volatility clustering on the return series of crude oil, Bitcoin and all selected stock exchanges of the current study. Secondly, the outcome of DCC, manifests that there is no short-run volatility spillover from crude oil to the Malaysian, Pakistani and South Korean and Turkish stock markets, whereas Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Singapore stock exchanges show the short-run volatility spillover from crude oil in the short run. On the other hand, in the long run, there is a volatility spillover effect from crude oil to all the stock exchanges. Thirdly, the findings suggest that there is no immediate spillover of volatility from Bitcoin to the stock markets return volatility of China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and Singapore. In contrast, both the Japanese and Turkish stock exchanges exhibit a short-term volatility spillover from Bitcoin. In the long term, a volatility spillover effect from Bitcoin is observed in all stock exchanges except for Malaysia. Lastly, based on the outcome of conditional variance, it can be concluded that there was increase in the return volatility of stock exchanges during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The analysis below does not account for the bias induced due to certain small sample properties of DCC-GARCH model. There exists a huge literature that suggests other methodologies for small sample corrections such as the DCC connectedness approach. On the other hand, decisive corollaries of the conclusions drawn above have been made purely based on a comprehensive investigation of eight Asian stock exchange economies. However, there is scope for inclusive examination by considering other Nordic and Western financial markets with panel data approach to get more robust inferences about the reality. Originality/value: Most of the empirical analysis in this perspective skewed towards the Nordic and Western countries. In addition to that many empirical investigations examine either the impact of crude oil price movement or Bitcoin performance on the stock market return volatility. However, none of the examinations quests the crude oil and Bitcoin together to unearth their implication on the stock market return volatility in a single study, especially in the Asian context. Hence, current investigation endeavours to examine the ramifications of Bitcoin and crude oil price movement on the stock market return volatility from an Asian perspective, which has significant implications for the investors of the Asian financial market. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Crude oil; Return volatility and GARCH DCC; Stock market","","","","","","","","Ahmed W.M., Stock market reactions to upside and downside volatility of Bitcoin: a quantile analysis, The North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 57, (2021); Alamgir F., Amin S.B., The nexus between oil price and stock market: evidence from South Asia, Energy Reports, 7, pp. 693-703, (2021); Attarzadeh A., Balcilar M., On the dynamic return and volatility connectedness of cryptocurrency, crude oil, clean energy, and stock markets: a time-varying analysis, Environ.

The purpose of this study is to the volatility and ”herd behavior” of the cryptocurrency, gold, and stock markets in the US. This research is aimed at investor ”herd behavior” and how it correlates with the volatility of three assets: the Standard & Poor’s 500 indexes, Bitcoin, and gold. Also, A new formula by applying the conditional standard deviation (risk), maximum return, minimum return, and average return to quantify the herding bias is designed in this research. In this study, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (GARCH) and the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) were both employed. Research results show that Bitcoin is 3.3 times as volatile as the S&P 500 and 4.6 times as volatile as gold. The results of this novel equation also show that the herding bias of Bitcoin is more than 26 times higher than the global average and 10 times higher than the S&P 500. Also, it’s important to consider the energy consumption and sustainability of investments when evaluating their long-term viability and risk. In some cases, investments in companies with strong sustainability practices and low carbon footprints may be seen as lower risk. Since Bitcoin relies on a network of computers to validate transactions based on proof of work and it is an energy consumption consensus mechanism, investment in Bitcoin may be seen as a higher risk. © 2023, Allameh Tabataba'i University.

Geographical work on cryptocurrencies has focussed on how their energy demand interacts with local communities and economies. Less is said about the organization of cryptoasset firms and their associated demands. This paper illuminates the complex geographies of one such firm, Bitfury Group, to investigate the global and national forms and structures such companies take and the factors encouraging them to concentrate operations in certain areas. To investigate the latter, we adopt the case study of Bitfury’s operations in Georgia, a South-Caucasian country where its presence is significant. We adapt Haberly et al.’s analytical framework to explore Bitfury’s geographical dimensions. We highlight how cheap electricity, regulatory and taxation regimes, personal encounters and personalities, and the materialities of hardware and energy-saving technology define these geographies and illuminate how Bitfury actively curates advantageous regulatory spaces. We encourage future work exploring Blockchain and Bitcoin technologies to understand the companies involved as simultaneously material and virtual, and as centrepieces in global networks interweaving production and finance. © The Author(s) 2023.","Bitcoin; Bitfury; Cryptocurrencies; Georgia; global financial networks","Georgia (republic); analytical framework; currency market; electronic commerce; energy conservation; energy intensity; financial market; local economy; tax system","","","","","European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (883107); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research underpinning this paper has been partially funded by the European Research Council Advanced Grant \u201CAlgorithmic Societies - Ethical Life in the Machine Learning Age\u201D.

Employing the QARDL method, this study examines both short- and long-term dynamics between macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin returns. Our analysis of monthly time series data from January 2011 to November 2023 reveals that volatile US economic policy indicators, such as high economic policy uncertainty, volatile inflation, and rising interest rates, have recently exerted a negative impact on Bitcoin returns. This study shows that these results are true not only for traditional money but also for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, despite their cardinal features. Its decentralized nature, indicating that it has no physical representation, is not tied to any authority or national economy and relies on a complex algorithm to track transactions. Further, it yields volatile returns that depend on macroeconomic indicators. © 2024 by the authors.","challenges in digital environment; digital economy; digital transformation; financial markets; financial risk management; investment decisions; risk","","","","","","","","Aiello D., Baker S.R., Balyuk T., Maggio M.D., Johnson M., Kotter J.D., Who Invests in Crypto?

Design/methodology/approach: We employed the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a comprehensive survey with 300 responses, and quantitative analysis using SmartPLS from December 2022 to March 2023. Findings: The findings reveal that the perceived usefulness of the Bitcoin market, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and herd behavior positively impact the Bitcoin investment decisions of individual investors in Vietnam. Research, Practical & Social Implications: This study provides regulators and relevant agencies with more practical evidence regarding the Bitcoin market, facilitating the formulation of appropriate management policies in an emerging economy. Originality/value: There is a shortage of research on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency investment market from the perspective of individual investors in emerging countries like Vietnam. Therefore, this study tries to shed light on individual investors with a comprehensive and objective overview to consider before making investment decisions. Additionally, the results can offer managers and relevant agencies empirical evidence to promulgate future regulations on the Bitcoin market. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Although historically designed as parallel computing accelerators for image rendering and videogames, graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in the explosion of both cryptoasset mining and machine learning models. The political economy associated with video games and Bitcoin and Ethereum mining provided a staggering growth in performance and energy efficiency and this, in turn, fostered a change in the epistemological understanding of AI: from rules-based or symbolic AI towards the matrix multiplications underpinning connectionism, machine learning and neural nets. Combining a material political economy of markets with a material epistemology of science, the article shows that there is no clear-cut division between software and hardware, between instructions and tools, and between frameworks of thought and the material and economic conditions of possibility of thought itself. As the microchip shortage and the growing geopolitical relevance of the hardware and semiconductor supply chain come to the fore, the paper invites social scientists to engage more closely with the materialities and hardware architectures of ‘virtual’ algorithms and software. © The Author(s) 2023.","artificial intelligence; ASIC; blockchain; cryptocurrency; GPU; hardware; materiality; TPU","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computers; Knowledge; Software; algorithm; artificial intelligence; knowledge; software","","","","","European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (883107)","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this paper was provided by the European Research Council Advanced Grant (883107 ALGOSOC) \u2018Algorithmic societies\u2014Ethical life in the machine learning age\u2019.

We develop a hybrid deep learning model based on feature selection in different frequency domains to enrich the literature of Bitcoin price prediction. Indicators such as Technology, Economy, Green Finance and Media Attention are considered. We first decompose all the data into different frequencies through CEEMDAN approach, and then the data at the same frequency are integrated into a Random Forest model to reduce the subset of potential predictors by measuring the importance of different factors. Finally, the selected factors are put into the LSTM/GRU to make the prediction of different components of Bitcoin prices at the same frequency, and aggregate together to obtain the predicted Bitcoin prices. The empirical results show that our proposed model outperforms the benchmark models, which is verified by MCS test. The proposed hybrid method obtains much higher return on investment in simulated trading than other benchmark models. Our study inspired the investors to accurately predict Bitcoin price and dig possible relationships between different assets and its determinants in frequency domain. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bitcoin price prediction; CEEMDAN; feature selection; hybrid deep learning; LSTM/GRU methods","decomposition analysis; frequency analysis; investment; machine learning; prediction; price dynamics","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province, (2022NSFSC1851); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72001180)","The work was supported by the\u00A0Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province [2022NSFSC1851]; National Natural Science Foundation of China grant [72001180].","Aharon D.Y., Umar Z., Vo X.V., Dynamic Spillovers Between the Term Structure of Interest Rates, Bitcoin, and Safe-Haven Currencies, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, pp. 1-25, (2021); Awoke T., Rout M., Mohanty L., Satapathy S.C., Bitcoin Price Prediction and Analysis Using Deep Learning Models, Communication Software and Networks.

The empirical results primarily reveal a high level of coherence between global market assets and Africa's sovereign CDS and yield-to-maturity, although varying across countries and time-frequency domain. Notably, the high degree of coherence and the positive co-movement between sovereign CDS and global market assets are more concentrated at the medium and upper frequency bands. The observed intensity of co-movements between global market assets and sovereign CDS/yield-to-maturity (YTM) of bond spread, with global market assets broadly serving as leading variables, suggests that an increased global investor's risk aversion positively affects the yields on Africa market bonds. Among the global market assets, we identified that VIX (which is implied volatility of S&P500) has the dominant influence on Africa sovereign CDS/YTM compared to that emanating from Bitcoin and Godman Sachs Commodity Index. This is highly conceivable as VIX gauges bubbling global risks and uncertainties which considerably influences investor's risk aversion. The heterogeneous lead/lag dynamics also provide useful information to global investors, including by utilizing African markets to rebalance their portfolios for risk management purposes. The empirical findings thus provide further critical information to investors for hedging purposes, and to policymakers in formulating sovereign risk management policies oriented towards minimizing sovereign default risks. © 2024 The Authors","Africa; Interdependence; International assets; Sovereign risk; Wavelet coherence","","","","","","","","Abolmakarem S., Abdi F., Khalili-Damghani K., Didehkhani H., Futuristic portfolio optimization problem: wavelet based long short-term memory, J.

The studies that have discussed social media analytics and digital economy on a global scale using bibliometric analysis are very less in numbers. Therefore, this study determines the trends and maps in the digital economy and social media analytics using VOSviewer. The present study analyses 1539 articles collected from the Scopus database and uses VOSviewer that creates a visual representation of the data. Analyses of co-occurrence of keywords, co-citation, journals, and co-authorship have been employed in the study. The findings of the study reveal the most prominent trends in terms of influence, most prolific journals, articles, authors, topics, keywords, and countries. Content analysis has been employed using the bibliographic coupling of documents to identify the broad themes of the clusters. Further, a conceptual quadrant model has been devised to examine the outcomes of the interrelation between social media analytics and digital economy. This study further reveals that research on digital economy and social media analytics has shifted from the developed world to the developing nations. Now, more and more research is being conducted in the countries like China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine and India. Through the density visualization of keywords analysis, it is revealed that keywords like “digitalization”, “artificial intelligence”, “blockchain”, “cryptocurrency”, and “bitcoin” are in trends of research in the subject matter. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bibliometric analysis; Digital economy; Digitalization; Social media analytics; VOSviewer","","","","","","","","Abrahams A.S., Jiao J., Wang G.A., Fan W., Vehicle defect discovery from social media, Decis.

Interconnectivity is becoming a fundamental feature of economic systems, including macroeconomic trends, traditional financial markets, and digital markets. Cryptocurrencies, as a new digital asset, are becoming an integral part of the global economy. This study aims to explore the relationships between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. We develop a methodology for analyzing the relationships between the largest cryptocurrencies and select global market-based economic indicators based on multimodal publicly available datasets incorporating structured numerical and unstructured news and social network data. To find the existence of directional associations, we develop an Explainable ML model that first learns the dependencies between different assets and then explains them in a form understandable by humans. We apply our methodology to analyze connectivity networks of seven cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink, Litecoin, Stellar, and Ripple) and seven classical economic indicators, including five market indexes (BSE, Dow Jones, S&P500, FTSE, and Hang Seng) and two commodity prices (Oil and Gold). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Classical economic indicators; Cryptocurrencies; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Networks","Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Classical economic indicator; Economic indicators; Economic system; Fundamental features; Interconnectivity; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Network; International trade","","","","","","","Milutinovic M., Et al., Cryptocurrency, Ekonomika, 1, pp. 105-122, (2018); Leetaru K., Schrodt P.A., Gdelt: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979–2012, ISA Annu.

While governments deliberate on how to regulate, some social media companies have removed creators of offensive content —deplatforming. I estimate the effects of deplatforming on revenue and viewership, using variation in the timing of removals across two video-streaming companies — YouTube, and its far-right competitor, Bitchute. Being deplatformed on Youtube results in a 30% increase in weekly Bitcoin revenue and a 50% increase in viewership on Bitchute. This increase in Bitchute activity is less than that on YouTube, meaning that deplatforming works in decreasing a content creator’s overall views and revenue. © The Author(s) 2023.","network analysis; political economy; social network analysis; social networks","","","","","","","","(2021); Ali S., Hammas Saeed M., Aldreabi E., Blackburn J., De Cristofaro E., Zannettou S., Stringhini G., WebSci ’21: WebSci ’21 13th ACM Web Science Conference 2021, Virtual Event United Kingdom, pp. 187-195, (2021); (2021); Balcells L., Torrats-Espinosa G., Using a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Electoral Consequences of Terrorist Attacks, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115, 42, pp. 10624-10629, (2018); Bogle A., Buying and Selling Extremism, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, (2021); Callaway B., Sant'Anna P.H.C., Difference-in-Differences with Multiple Time Periods, Journal of Econometrics, 225, 2, pp. 200-230, (2020); Carter A.V., Schnepel K.T., Steigerwald D.G., Asymptotic Behavior of a t-Test Robust to Cluster Heterogeneity, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 99, 4, pp. 698-709, (2017); A Problem of Epik Proportions, (2019); Stefan Molyneux, (2021); Chan N.W., Gillingham K., The Microeconomic Theory of the Rebound Effect and Its Welfare Implications, Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, 2, 1, pp. 133-159, (2015); Chandrasekharan E., Pavalanathan U., Srinivasan A., Glynn A., Jacob E., Gilbert E., You Can’t Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit’s 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 1, (2017); (2021); Cremin M.R., Popescu B.G., Sticks and Stones?

By applying advanced econometric techniques, this research empirically tests the dynamic impacts of Bitcoin trading, economic growth, and energy use on CO2 emissions in the top 20 Bitcoin-trading emerging market economies from 2013 to 2020, highlighting results on the existence of cross-section dependence, slope heterogeneity, and unit roots in the panel data. Moreover, Bitcoin trading, economic growth, and energy use have a significantly positive effect on CO2 emissions from a long-term perspective. Findings further show that CO2 emissions have a bi-causal correlation with all three determinants. Relevant implications are offered as follows. For academic researchers, cross-section dependence and slope heterogeneity are important considerations, and ignoring them would lead to significantly biased inferences. Emerging market governments should introduce eco-friendly technology for Bitcoin trading, modify the present extensive mode of economic growth, and guard against unsustainable energy consumption. © 2023","Bitcoin trading;

The Chinese financial market experienced the first consequences of the covid-19 pandemic, then spilled over to other financial markets, including those for cryptocurrencies and the precious metals. This study examines the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the volatilities of the dynamics of bitcoin and gold. Both assets share some characteristics, such as online trading platforms, however, gold is a tangible financial asset unlike bitcoin, which is digitally generated without any physical form. This study argues that the similarities and differences between bitcoin and gold play major roles in how the covid-19 crisis affected their respective dynamics. Using daily data ranging from 9/22/2014 to 1/ 31/2023 and employing ARMA as the mean equation for GARCH model, the impact of the health crisis (covid-19) is examined on the volatilities of the prices and volumes of bitcoin and gold. Empirical evidence points out that, the pandemic has a symmetric impact on the volatilities of bitcoin and gold price returns, causing them to be more volatile. The impact of the covid-19 observed on the volume returns of the assets, however, is asymmetrical. The empirical results give evidence to the role that the vital differences existing between these assets played during the covid-19 pandemic. Copyright: © 2023 Badshah et al.

Building upon the Polanyian notion of double movement and the international financial subordination research program, I contend that the ideology of the governing party and the strength of popular mobilization still contribute to policy variegation in capital flow management even at the bottom of the global currency hierarchy. The case studies on Ecuador and El Salvador since the late 2000s provide support for this argument. In both countries, administrations led by post-neoliberal left-wing parties tightened capital flow management, while their right-wing successors gave a new impulse to capital mobility. However, these regulatory cycles varied according to the strength of popular pressures. In Ecuador, where social movements had a strong mobilizational capacity, post-neoliberal governments deployed encompassing capital controls, while their right-wing successor had to follow a gradualist approach in their liberalizing agenda. In El Salvador, on the other hand, given the relative weakness of the bottom-up pressure, post-neoliberal administrations pursued a targeted macroprudential approach, while the right-wing successor faced little resistance to implementing a radical neoliberal agenda that included even the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender alongside the United States dollar. © 2024 The Author(s).

Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The adoption of blockchain, as well as the technology and products it enables, will continue to have a significant influence on company operations. However, blockchain technology is much more than a secure cryptocurrency transfer method. It may be utilised in areas other than finance, including as healthcare, insurance, voting, welfare benefits, gaming and artist royalties. The global economy is prepared for the blockchain revolution, with the technology already having an influence on business and society on many levels. If the term ""revolution""seems extreme, consider that eight of the world's ten largest corporations are developing a variety of blockchain-based solutions. Any enterprise or organisation that is engaged in the recording and oversight of any type of transaction stands to profit from shifting its operations to a blockchain-based platform. This paper discusses about the various roles blockchain has taken up over the years in several different industries along with the future opportunities and scope of expansion to numerous other professional sectors. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Blockchain technology; smart agriculture; smart applications; smart era; smart healthcare","Bitcoin; Health care; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Company operation; Health-care insurance; Market valuations; Smart agricultures; Smart applications; Smart era; Smart healthcare; Transfer method; Blockchain","","","","","","","Abd El-Latif AA, Abd-El-Atty B, Mehmood I, Muhammad K, Venegas-Andraca SE, Peng J, Quantum-inspired blockchain-based cybersecurity: Securing smart edge utilities in IoT-based smart cities, Information Processing & Management, 58, 4, (2021); Afrashtehfar KI, Abu-Fanas AS, Metaverse, crypto, and NFTs in dentistry, Education Sciences, 12, 8, (2022); Agbo C, Mahmoud Q, Eklund J, Blockchain technology in healthcare: A systematic review, Healthcare, 7, 2, (2019); Aggarwal S, Kumar N, Attacks on blockchain, Advances in Computers, 121, pp. 399-410, (2021); Ahmad RW, Hasan H, Jayaraman R, Salah K, Omar M, Blockchain applications and architectures for port operations and logistics management, Research in Transportation Business & Management, 41, (2021); Ali O, Ally M, Clutterbuck, Dwivedi Y., The state of play of blockchain technology in the financial services sector: A systematic literature review, International Journal Information Management, 54, (2020); Alketbi A, Nasir Q, Talib MA, Blockchain for government services - Use cases, security benefits and challenges, 2018 15th Learning and Technology Conference (L&T), pp. 112-119, (2018); Alnafrah I, Mouselli S, Revitalizing blockchain technology potentials for smooth academic records management and verification in low-income countries, International Journal of Educational Development, 85, (2021); Aysan AF, Khan AU, Topuz H, Tunali AS, Survival of the fittest: A natural experiment from crypto exchanges, The Singapore Economic Review, pp. 1-20, (2021); Baiod W, Light J, Mahanti A, Blockchain technology and its applications across multiple domains: A survey, Journal of International Technology and Information Management, 29, 4, pp. 78-119, (2021); Bakhytzhan B, Magauiya A, Tuktibayeva M, Gaukhar T, The use of blockchain technology in the field of digital music, 2021 16th International Conference on Electronics Computer and Computation, pp. 1-3, (2021); Bandara E, Shetty S, Mukkamala R, Liang X, Foytik P, Ranasinghe N, De Zoysa K, Casper: A blockchain-based system for efficient and secure customer credential verification, Journal of Banking and Financial Technology, 6, 1, pp. 43-62, (2022); Batubara FR, Ubacht J, Janssen M, Challenges of blockchain technology adoption for e-government: A systematic literature review, Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research: Governance in the Data Age, pp. 1-9, (2018); Bresnick J, Exploring the use of blockchain for EHRs, healthcare big data, (2017); Casino F, Dasaklis TK, Patsakis C, A systematic literature review of blockchainbased applications: Current status, classification and open issues, Telematics Informat, 36, pp. 55-81, (2019); Chen HS, Jarrell JT, Carpenter KA, Cohen DS, Huang X, Blockchain in healthcare: A patient-centered model, Biomedical Journal of Science Technical Research, 20, 3, (2019); Chen J, Lin D, Wu J, Do cryptocurrency exchanges fake trading volumes?

However, their high volatility characteristics present new challenges in investment decision-making and risk assessment. To capture the characteristics comprehensively, this paper proposes a novel approach for constructing confidence regions for interval-valued variables based on the exponentially decay weighted bootstrap. The coverage area of the confidence regions and tail quantiles provide new indicators for assessing the volatility and tail risks in the market. Empirical results using Bitcoin as a case study demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms other traditional point-based methods such as exponential weighted moving average in measuring the uncertainty and intraday price volatility. Furthermore, the derived tail quantiles exhibit superior predictive performance for tail risk compared to Value-at-risk methods and the exponential weighted moving average, as evidenced by various tests. The proposed methodology not only contributes a new statistical tool for analyzing digital currency volatility but also provides novel perspectives for extreme risk management in financial markets. © 2024 Science China Press.

Given these fundamental differences, it is interesting to examine how the notions of market efficiency apply to crypto markets, especially because the arguments of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970) and the adaptive market hypothesis (Lo, 2004, and Lo, 2008) were originally developed in the context of traditional financial markets. Research on the informational efficiency of crypto markets has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper examines the evolving efficiency of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, especially during the period when economies around the world were devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For a newly-emerged cryptocurrency with a market that is essentially global, a global shock like the COVID-19 pandemic presents ideal conditions for assessing how efficiency evolves as the market faces a series of shocks. Employing a fixed-length rolling window approach, this paper carries out the following tests: the automatic portmanteau test of Escanciano and Lobato (2009), the wild bootstrap automatic variance ratio test proposed by Kim (2009), the generalized spectral test of Escaciano and Valesco (2006), and the test proposed by Dominguez and Lobato (2003). The results provide evidence of episodes of inefficiency in a market that is efficient over extended periods. The inefficiency index constructed in this study shows that the Bitcoin market went through proportionately longer and more frequent episodes of inefficiency during the COVID-19 period. This is in line with the adaptive market hypothesis and has practical significance for investors and regulators. © 2024, Pro Global Science Association.

This research studied how the shock spillover system is affected by three significant factors: Bitcoins, unpredictability, and the China stock market between 2014 and 2021. While much earlier empirical research has looked at risk dispersion in different financial markets, this article will zero in on green markets. This investigation seeks to accomplish something that has never been done before: determine whether or not green commodities, Bitcoin, and uncertainty impact the performance of the China stock market. The following are significant results based on a quantile vector autoregressive (VAR) connection. (i) A static spillover system indicates that information was widely shared across markets during intense market circumstances. (ii) The global green economy and clean energy marketplaces are the primary sources of knowledge spillover in adverse market conditions. This research elucidates the asymmetrical influence of green products, Bitcoin, and market volatility in China. This is vital due to the dynamic nature of international and regional connections. Recent studies have shown that shock spillovers are excellent for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), uncertainty indices, and global carbon indexes, but bad for most eco-friendly products. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; China; Green commodities; Quantile VAR network; Spillover effects; Stock markets","Carbon; China; Empirical Research; Health Care Sector; Knowledge; China; carbon; commodity market; connectivity; green economy; health care; knowledge; research work; spillover effect; stock market; China; empirical research; health care cost; knowledge","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ","","","","","Adebayo T.S., Kirikkaleli D., Adeshola I., Oluwajana D., Akinsola G.D., Osemeahon O.S., Coal consumption and environmental sustainability in South Africa: the role of financial development and globalization, Int J Renew Energy Dev, 10, 3, pp. 527-536, (2021); Aftab J., Abid N., Sarwar H., Veneziani M., Environmental ethics, green innovation, and sustainable performance: exploring the role of environmental leadership and environmental strategy, J Clean Prod, 378, September, (2022); Al Mamun M., Boubaker S., Nguyen D.K., Green finance and decarbonization: evidence from around the world, Financ Res Lett, 46, PB, (2022); Anu, Singh A.K., Raza S.A., Nakonieczny J., Shahzad U., Role of financial inclusion, green innovation, and energy efficiency for environmental performance?

Results: The key prerequisites for the application of effective regulatory approaches to transactions with crypto currencies and directions for building the legislative and regulatory framework for such transactions in Ukraine are presented. Conclusion: It is established that: virtual currency is different from fiat currency; virtual currency differs from electronic money, because electronic money is always real currency with the status of legal tender and does not change the unit of account, but stores it in electronic form; virtual currency is a subcategory of digital currency. It is established that: that the development of the legal status of virtual currency should take into account the peculiarities of social relations related to its ""life activity"". The norms that regulate the legal status of virtual currency and the specifics of its circulation in the economy of Ukraine should be established at the legislative level. © 2024, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

Blue economy assets, which refer to sectors that sustainably utilize ocean resources, are a key focus alongside green finance assets. The findings reveal that during crises, Bitcoin demonstrates robust safe-haven characteristics, particularly against blue economy assets like BJLE and OCEN. Conversely, gold exhibits pronounced safe-haven properties against specific blue economy and green finance assets such as BJLE and FAN. The GO-GARCH model highlights gold’s strong diversification and safe-haven roles, especially against BJLE. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is more effective as a diversifier for PIO. Moreover, the GO-GARCH model consistently outperforms the DCC and ADCC models in terms of hedging effectiveness, showing that gold is the preferred hedging instrument for GNR and TAN, while Bitcoin is more effective for other blue and green assets. The results underscore the distinct roles of Bitcoin and gold in portfolio management strategies, offering insights for investors navigating market uncertainties in the context of sustainable investments. © 2025 Manzli et al.

This transformation shakes the very foundations of the existence and purpose of law, i.e., the regulation of social relations. However, today, the consequences of developing tech in an unsustainable manner are becoming obvious. Despite the internet’s many benefits, it also erodes trust and fuels misinformation, polarization, and inequality. These developments occur partly because the algorithms that shape our economies, society, and even public discourse were developed with few legal restrictions or commonly held ethical standards. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the technologies that currently shape our socio-economic relations must be consistent with both our shared norms and values and the existing rules. The main question of this study is how to correctly introduce tech that is legal by design, but also, and especially, liable and sustainable by design. The underlying questions are hence, firstly: to this end, do we need (to create) a whole new body of norms, law, and regulation? Alternatively, are there already legal fields, concepts, and tools that can help us lay comprehensive groundwork for tech that is liable and sustainable by design? The central object of this study is to address this problem with regard to the types of organization that is in any way involved in or at least related to tech and innovation, essentially, the Web 3-4 actors. My principal method is systems analysis, which engages with a system as a whole. The construct of regulatory compliant and sustainable tech is thus analysed both functionally and institutionally, with concepts including norm-setting and law-making, formal application and enforcement, case law, real-world effects, and limitations. The objective of the article is to first synthesize the pre-existing legal and regulatory fields and constructs, and then analyse in a succinct yet systematic manner the conditions for their applicability to, and efficiency for, regulation of Web 3.0 (and soon, Web 4.0), as well as their limits. In the course of the study, I found that there are a few pre-existing legal fields, concepts, and tools that can pave the way to creating a Web that is liable and sustainable by design. I have also identified two key developments that arise from the digital transformation: (i) the digital economic space creates the so-called governance and regulatory gaps; and (ii) some of these gaps are rapidly filled (at times, successfully and at times, less so) by a burgeoning newest legal framework (national and supranational targeted regulation, legislation, and case law), which has been growing especially rapidly since the global digital ‘leap’ facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the beginning of the 2020s. To conclude, the article summarizes both pre-existing and new tools and thus offers a ready-to-use toolkit for a regulatory compliant and sustainable tech (including a table summarizing the toolkit), which is the key aim of this paper. © 2023 by the author.","AI ethics; bitcoin; blockchain; ChatGPT; compliance; cryptoassets; cyber-security; DAO; data; digital economy; digital services; due diligence; EU AI Act; GDPR; generative AI; intellectual property for AI; legal by design; NFTs; profiling; startups; sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI); sustainable digital ecosystem; tech & innovation law; Web 3; web sustainability","algorithm; artificial intelligence; design; digitization; economic analysis; ethics; innovation; intellectual property rights; Internet; sustainability","","","","","","","Jay Hoofnagle C., van der Sloot B., Zuiderveen Borgesius F., The European Union general data protection regulation: What it is and what it means, Inf.

This study aims to test the relationship between technology acceptance factors and investment decisions in Bitcoin of Thai investors focus the southern region of Thailand. This is a quantitative research study conducted through a survey of 400 Bitcoin investors, sampled primarily through online social networks using a closed-ended questionnaire. The study examines five technology acceptance factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived risk, social influence, and facilitating conditions that may affect investment decisions in Bitcoin. The study found that the sample group had a high level of acceptance of Bitcoin in all areas and had a significant correlation with investment decisions in Bitcoin overall, which is statistically significant at 0.05. However, when considering the influence of technology acceptance factors that affect investment decisions in Bitcoin, it was found that there were 4 statistically significant factors at the 0.05 level of significance, including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived risk, and facilitating conditions. Among these factors, the performance expectancy had the most effect on investment decisions in Bitcoin among investors in the southern region of Thailand. These study results reflect the confidence of investors in the southern region of Thailand in investing in Bitcoin, and it is an opportunity for both the public and private sectors to collaborate to promote the development of digital currencies systems in Thailand to become the center of the digital asset economy system in the region. © (2024), (Greater Mekong Subregion Academic and Research Network).

The main motivation of the study relates to examining the dynamic volatility connectedness mentioned during periods of important events such as the recent coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict which has shown the vulnerability of economic and financial assets, energy commodities, and clean energy. The novel Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) approach is employed for the investigation of the sample period mentioned. Empirical analysis reveals that both the total and net volatility connectedness between assets is time-varying. The highest connectedness among the assets is observed with the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and it increases with some important international events, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict, the referendum of Brexit, China–US trade war, and Brexit day. On average, the result shows that 32.8% of the volatility in one asset spills over to all other assets. The DCC-GARCH results also indicate that crude oil, bonds, and Bitcoin act as almost pure volatility transmitters, whereas the Dollar index, gold, and S&P500 act as volatility receivers. On the other hand, clean energy is found neutral to external shocks until the first quarter of 2020 and after that time, it starts to behave as a volatility transmitter. Based on the obtained results, we offer some specific policy implications that are beneficial to the US economy and other countries.

GDP per capita measures economic growth. Bitcoin transactions volume, private sector credit and foreign direct investment measured currency circulation using Engle-Granger residual co-integration, fully modified OLS, dynamic OLS and conical co-integration regression. Results unveil long-term relationship between crypto currencies and economic growth. The findings indicate a negative long-run association between LNBVT and GDP. The Central Bank of Nigeria and government should improve the legal system to regulate crypto currencies transactions. This research suggests implementation of effective laws on crypto currencies transactions to limit crypto currencies’ negativities in the global economy. This is possible if the crypto currencies’ developers create geographically delimited or encrypted protocols. This study recommends that all economic actors should be open-minded towards technological innovations. The suggested policies would improve crypto currency acceptance in the economies globally. The authorities should regulate crypto currencies’ usage and security from illegal activities. © 2025 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","CCR; conical co-integration regression; crypto currency; DOLS; dynamic OLS; economic growth; FMOLS; fully modified OLS; Nigeria","","","","","","","","Agbo E.I., Nwadialor E.O., Crypto currency and the African economy, Economics and Social Sciences Academic Journal, 2, 6, pp. 82-97, (2020); Agu J.C., Impact of crypto currency on Africa’s economy, International Journal of Business Management and Commerce, 1, 2, pp. 16-39, (2020); Aisen A., Veiga F.J., Does political instability lead to higher inflation?

The results based on the data from January 9, 2014 to May 31, 2022 reveal that compared with gold, Bitcoin consistently provides diversification opportunities with all six representative market indices examined, specifically under the normal market condition. In particular, for short-term horizons, Bitcoin shows favorably low correlation with each index for all years, whereas exception is observed for gold. In addition, diversification between Bitcoin and gold is demonstrated as well, mainly for short-term investments. However, the diversification benefit is conditional for both Bitcoin and gold under the recent pandemic and war crises. The findings remind investors and portfolio managers planning to incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios as a diversification tool to be aware of the global geopolitical conditions and other uncertainty in considering their investment tools and durations. © 2023, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; Coherence; Diversification; Gold; Wavelet","","","","","","","","Agnese P., Thoss J., (2021); Aguiar-Conraria L., Azevedo N., Soares M.J., Using wavelets to decompose the time-frequency effects of monetary policy, Phys A Stat Mech Appl, 387, 12, pp. 2863-2878, (2008); Agyei S.K., Adam A.M., Bossman A., Asiamah O., Junior P.O., Asafo-Adjei R., Asafo-Adjei E., Does volatility in cryptocurrencies drive the interconnectedness between the cryptocurrencies market?

Further cryptocurrency mining is impacting the economy in an adverse fashion. Moreover, impact of gold mining, extraction on Blue-Green economy and even relationship with cryptocurrency is another interesting facet. Therefore, we delved into the interconnectedness among five indices, two of which focus on the green economy (ICLN-iShares and CNRG-SandP), whereas three are on the blue economy (BJLE-BNP Paribas ESG Blue Economy ETF and PIO-Invesco Global Water ETF) and OCEN (IQ Clean Oceans ETF) alongside the traditional assets Bitcoin and gold indices. We considered between October 26, 2021, to January 5, 2024 for the study. This study highlighted some cardinal findings. First, BJLE can be used as a hedge against OCEN and PIO (all are in Blue economy). Second, excessive water usage in Bitcoin mining is detrimental to Blue-Green economy. Third, positive policy shock force spillover effect to cool down. Fourth, spillover typically increases as both economic uncertainty (US Banks collapse in 2023) and geopolitical risk (Russia-Ukraine conflict) increase. Fifth, there has been an increased responsiveness of these markets to immediate events (near-term bias). Therefore, this study would assist the policymakers and investors, especially in the Blue-Green domain. © 2025, Econjournals.

This study investigates Bitcoin's adherence to currency criteria and its consequences for GDP development in a certain country. The mining industry plays a significant role in the GDP of many countries. The extraction of raw materials such as metals, minerals, and fossil fuels is essential for producing a wide range of goods and services. This generates jobs and tax revenues and supports economic growth. Understanding these processes is critical, given the ongoing debate about Bitcoin's place in modern economies. This research looks into Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency and its possible influence on a certain country's GDP. The results show that Bitcoin fits the requirements for money, acting as a means of exchange and a store of value, with features including mobility, divisibility, commensurability, and fungibility. When examining its influence on GDP, empirical data indicate that, while currency appreciation may provide the illusion of stronger GDP growth when denominated in foreign currency, it damages growth domestically. According to a neural network study, Bitcoin's large impact on GDP renders it unsuitable for use as a national currency in the Czech Republic. Despite matching currency criteria, Bitcoin's adoption confronts problems such as volatility, a lack of central authority, and its worldwide nature, which limit its usefulness in promoting national economic growth. This analysis emphasizes country selection and length restrictions, finding that Bitcoin's existing position as an investment instrument restricts its viability as a national currency. © 2024 by the authors.","Bitcoin; Gross Domestic Product; Mining Industry; National Currency; Neural Networks","","","","","","Institute of Technology and Business in České Budějovice","Institute of Technology and Business in \u010Cesk\u00E9 Bud\u011Bjovice.","Almeida J., Goncalves T.

However, one major drawback of blockchain investments is their substantial energy consumption, which has negative impacts on both the economy and the environment. The main cause of concern is the generation of atmospheric carbon emissions resulting from excessive energy usage. This research study aims to identify blockchain networks and systems that assert themselves as environmentally friendly and determine which of them produces the least amount of carbon emissions, such as Cardano, Tezos, and Bitgreen. This has been accomplished by following a comprehensive hybrid literature review. Our study has identified 23 blockchain networks that consume significantly less power and release fewer carbon dioxide emissions compared to the Bitcoin network. Some of these environmentally friendly networks include Algorand, Fantom, MobileCoin, and Electroneum. Additionally, we have found various projects and organizations that support greener blockchain initiatives, such as the Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism, Green Digital Finance Alliance, GreenTrust, and the Energy Web Foundation. While several projects in this area have been recognized and examined, comprehensive research and analysis are still needed to provide empirical evidence regarding the power consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of these claimed environmentally friendly blockchains. This is due to the relatively early stage of development in this field. © 2023 The Authors","Blockchain; Climate change; Ecosystem; Energy; Green blockchain; Sustainability","Blockchain; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy utilization; Global warming; Investments; Atmospheric carbon; Block-chain; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Energy; Energy-consumption; Excessive energy; Green blockchain; Substantial energy; Sustainable development","","","","","","","AlAhmad A.S., Kahtan H., Alzoubi Y.I., Ali O., Jaradat A., Mobile cloud computing models security issues: a systematic review, J.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional financial systems often face challenges such as limited access to banking services, high transaction costs, and volatile currencies, Bitcoin presents both opportunities and risks. Understanding the interplay between Bitcoin and key monetary indicators such as monetary aggregates, exchange rates, and interest rates can provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in these economies. This study therefore seeks to investigate the nexus between monetary indicators and Bitcoin in selected Sub-Saharan African countries using a Panel ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) approach. The analysis focuses on understanding the dynamic relationship between key monetary variables, such as monetary aggregates, exchange rates, interest rates, and Bitcoin prices, from 2010 quarter three to 2022 quarter four. The findings reveal several significant relationships between monetary indicators and Bitcoin across the selected Sub-Saharan African countries. In the short run of the Panel Ardl monetary aggregates exhibit a positive relationship with Bitcoin prices, indicating that changes in the money supply may influence the demand for cryptocurrencies. Conversely, both exchange rates and interest rates show a negative relationship with Bitcoin prices in the short run, suggesting that currency depreciat ion and higher borrowing costs may reduce demand for Bitcoin. In the long run, the relationship between monetary aggregates and Bitcoin remains positive, emphasizing the potential influence of money supply on cryptocurrency markets over time. However, the significance of exchange rates diminishes, indicating a less pronounced impact in the longer term. Interestingly, interest rates continue to exhibit a significant negative relationship with Bitcoin prices in the long run, highlighting the persistent effect of borrowing costs on cryptocurrency demand. These results have important implications for policymakers, investors, and researchers interested in the intersection of monetary policy and cryptocurrency markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Policymakers may consider the impact of monetary policy decisions on cryptocurrency adoption and market dynamics, while investors can use these insights to inform their investment strategies. © 2024, ASERS Publishing House.

These innovative transaction methods have rapidly made their mark in the financial sector, reshaping the dynamics of the global economy. However, there remains a notable hesitation in its widespread acceptance and adoption, largely due to misconceptions and lack of proper guidance about its use. Such gaps in understanding create an opportunity to address these concerns. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study develops a parsimonious model to explain the awareness, acceptance, and adoption of cryptocurrency. The model was assessed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 332 participants aged 18 to 40 years. The findings suggest that cryptocurrency awareness plays a direct, positive, and significant role in shaping cryptocurrency adoption and that this positive relationship is mediated by factors that exemplify cryptocurrency acceptance, namely the ease of use and usefulness of cryptocurrency. The results also reveal that trust is a significant factor that strengthens these direct and mediating relationships. These insights emphasize the necessity of fostering an informed understanding of cryptocurrencies to accelerate their broader adoption in the financial ecosystem. By addressing the misconceptions and reinforcing factors like ease of use, usefulness, and trust, policymakers and financial institutions can better position themselves to integrate and promote cryptocurrency in mainstream financial systems. © 2024, The Author(s).","","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72074014, 72174016); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work received financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant numbers 72074014 and 72174016.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a data set of 58 state-level marijuana decriminalisation and legalisation bills and referenda in the USA in 2010–2022. Findings: Decriminalisation is associated with a strong and consistent positive Bitcoin price response around the event, recreational legalisation induces a more ambiguous reaction and medical legalisation is found to have a negative albeit small impact on Bitcoin value. This suggests decriminalisation enhances shadow economy use value of Bitcoin, whereas recreational and medical legalisation are not consistently reducing illicit drug cryptomarket activity. The effects are robust to various estimation windows, in subsamples, and also when outliers, heavy tails, conditional heteroskedasticity and state size are accounted for. Originality/value: New to the literature, the choice of US marijuana bills, specifically as sample events, is based on both theoretical and empirical grounds. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cannabis; Event study; Illicit Market; Shadow economy","","","","","","","","Afik Z., Cohen T., Lahav Y., Getting high on cannabis stock returns: an event study, Finance Research Letters, 46, (2022); Aldridge J., Decary-Hetu D., Hidden wholesale: the drug diffusing capacity of online drug cryptomarkets, International Journal of Drug Policy, 35, 1, pp. 7-15, (2016); Alexander C., Dakos M., A critical investigation of cryptocurrency data and analysis, Quantitative Finance, 20, 2, pp. 173-188, (2020); Almaqableh L., Wallace D., Pereira V., Ramiah V., Wood G., Veron J., Moosa I., Watson A., Is it possible to establish the link between drug busts and the cryptocurrency market?

The steady rise in the movement of South Africans’ investments between the rand and BitCoin warrants an investigation as to which of the two currencies is riskier. In this paper, the Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) model is employed to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) for the two exchange rates, BitCoin/US dollar (BitCoin) and the South African rand/US dollar (ZAR/USD). The estimated risk measures are used to compare the riskiness of the two exchange rates. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method is used to find the optimal parameters of the GPD model. The higher extreme value index estimate associated with the BTC/USD when compared with the ZAR/USD estimate, suggests that the BTC/USD is riskier than the ZAR/USD. The computed VaR estimates for losses of $0.07, $0.09, and $0.16 per dollar invested in the BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99% compared to the ZAR/USD’s $0.02, $0.02, and $0.03 at the respective levels of significance, confirm that BitCoin is riskier than the rand. The ES (average losses) of $0.11, $0.13, and $0.21 per dollar invested in the BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99% compared to the ZAR/USD’s $0.02, $0.02, and $0.03 at the respective levels of significance further confirm the higher risk associated with BitCoin. Model adequacy is confirmed using the Kupiec test procedure. These findings are helpful to risk managers when making adequate risk-based capital requirements more rational between the two currencies. The argument is for more capital requirements for BitCoin than for the South African rand. © 2023 by the authors.","BitCoin; cryptocurrency; exchange rates; Extreme Value Theory; Generalised Pareto Distribution; rand","","","","","","","","Almeida J., Goncalves T.C., Portfolio Diversification, Hedge and Safe-Haven Properties in Cryptocurrency Investments and Financial Economics: A Systematic Literature Review, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, (2023); Artzner P., Delbaen F., Jean-Marc E., Heath D.D., Coherent Measures of Risk, Mathematical Finance, 9, pp. 203-228, (1999); Bader B., Yan J., eva: Extreme Value Analysis with Goodness-of-Fit Testing, (2020); Balkema A.A., de Haan L., Residual lifetime at great age, Annals of Probability, 2, pp. 792-804, (1974); Beirlant J., Vynckier P., Teugels J.L., Tail index estimation, Pareto quantile plots, and regression diagnostics, Journal of American Statistical Association, 91, pp. 1659-1667, (1996); Beirlant J., Dierckx G., Guillou A., Estimation of the extreme-value index and generalized quantile plots, Bernoulli, 11, pp. 949-970, (2005); Bouri E., Molnar P., Azzi G., Roubaud D., Hagfors L.I., On the hedge and safe haven properties of BitCoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?, Finance Research Letters, 20, pp. 192-198, (2017); Caeiro F., Gomes M.I., Pestana D., Direct reduction of bias of the classical hill estimator, Revstat, 3, pp. 113-136, (2005); Cai J.-J., de Haan L., Zhou C., Bias correction in extreme value statistics with index around zero, Extremes, 16, pp. 173-201, (2013); Chen J.M., On Exactitude in Financial Regulation: Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, and Expectiles, Risks, 6, (2018); Chikobvu D., Ndlovu T., The Generalised Extreme Value Distribution Approach to Comparing the Riskiness of BitCoin/US Dollar and South African Rand/US Dollar Returns, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, (2023); Chou H.-C., Wang D.K., Estimation of Tail-Related Value-at-Risk Measures: Range Based Extreme Value Approach, Quantitative Finance, 14, pp. 293-304, (2014); Danielsson J., Financial Risk Forecasting, (2011); Davies M., Is South Africa the Next Brazil?, Emerging Market Insights, (2017); Dekkers A.L.M., Einmahl J.H.J., de Haan L., A moment estimator for the index of an extreme-value distribution, Annals of Statistics, 17, pp. 1833-1855, (1989); Dyhrberg A.H., BitCoin, gold and the dollar—A Garch volatility analysis, Finance Research Letters, 16, pp. 85-92, (2016); Fisher R., Tippett L., Limiting forms of the frequency distribution of the largest or smallest member of a sample, Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 24, pp. 180-190, (1928); Fratzscher M., On Currency Crises and Contagion, (2002); Ghalanos A., rugarch: Univariate GARCH Models, (2020); Gneiting T., Making and evaluating point forecasts, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 106, pp. 746-762, (2011); Grable J., Financial risk tolerance and additional factors that affect risk taking in everyday money matters, Journal of Business and Psychology, 14, pp. 625-630, (2000); Heffernan J.E., Stephenson A.G., ismev: An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values, (2018); Hull J., Risk Management and Financial Institutions, (2006); Ibrahim M., Emam W., Tashkandy Y., Ali M.M., Yousof H.M., Bayesian and Non-Bayesian Risk Analysis and Assessment under Left-Skewed Insurance Data and a Novel Compound Reciprocal Rayleigh Extension, Mathematics, 11, (2023); Joale D., Analyzing the Effect of Exchange Rate Volatility on South Africa’s Exports to the US—Theory and Evidence, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2011); Kaseke F., Ramroop S., Mwambi H., A Comparison of the Stylised Facts of BitCoin, Ethereum and the JSE Stock Returns, African Finance Journal, 23, pp. 50-64, (2021); Kupiec P.H., Techniques for verifying the accuracy of risk management models, Journal of Derivatives, 3, pp. 73-84, (1995); Markowitz H., Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments, (1959); Penalva H., Nunes S., Neves M.M., Extreme Value Analysis—A Brief Overview With an Application to Flow Discharge Rate Data in A Hydrometric Station In The North Of Portugal, REVSTAT—Statistical Journal Volume, 14, pp. 193-215, (2016); Pflug G.C., Some Remarks on the Value-at-Risk and the Conditional Value-at-Risk.

Purpose: This paper aimed to evaluate the comovements between the USA (S&P 500), Germany (DAX 30), France (CAC40), Japan (Nikkei 225), Canada (TSX), Russia (MOEX) and Ukraine (PFTS) stock markets and the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litcoin (LTC) Dash (DASH/USD), Ripple (XRP) DigiByte (DGB) and Nem (XEM), from February 24, 2022, to April 12, 2023 Methods: The approach to our research question will involve using the causality econometric model, Granger SVAR (Vector Autoregressive). Results: The results showed that stock indices and digital currencies show sharp structural breaks, and not all markets influence cryptocurrencies. The MOEX stock market affects the price formation of BTC, ETH, DGB, XEM, and XRP, while the DAX 30 stock index impacts ETH, LTC, DASH, DGB, and XEM. The Ukraine market (PFTS) influences ETH, but the other stock markets do not influence any of the cryptocurrencies analysed. Conclusion: Investors, policymakers, and other participants operating in the digital currency markets can find valuable information in the study's conclusions when seeking to rebalance their portfolios. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

We contribute to the literature by presenting empirical evidence of short-term abnormal returns surrounding the crypto-related announcement day, indicating positive reactions from investors in an emerging market. Firms investing directly in cryptocurrency are associated with higher abnormal returns than those investing indirectly. Additionally, direct-investment firms become more correlated with and sensitive to Bitcoin price movements after crypto-related announcements, indicating a stronger tie with the cryptocurrency market. In light of these results, investors and market participants are reminded to monitor the evolving relationship between firms investing in cryptocurrencies and their stock performance and the potential spillover effects on broader financial markets in emerging economies. © 2024 Chulalognkorn University.

For this purpose, the sample included a range of economies with the highest number of Bitcoin usages or transactions. For this purpose, the sample included a range of economies with the highest number of Bitcoin usages or transactions, according to recent international rankings. With specific empirical means on panel data modelling, we attempted to show that economic growth, was influenced negatively by the cryptocurrency ‘Bitcoin’, and we concluded that this instrument leads to an increase in the inflation rate in a country according to the quantity theory of money and leads to a disorder in the monetary policy of a country. Our framework shows that the economic growth proxy was substantially influenced positively by economic indicators such as technology, investment and education but negatively by the high rate of participation, which caused an increase in unemployment. Our empirical results offer insights and insist on the importance of the intervention of the authorities to oversee and control the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin to avoid its negative effects and implement a strategy that overcomes these effects from a macroeconomic perspective.

EMD is utilized to decompose signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which delineate variations across different frequency scales, thus facilitating the identification of distinct oscillations and trends within the signals. The study reveals a significant positive connectedness between Bitcoin and most GCC stock markets, albeit with some variations observed across countries and time periods. Employing multiresolutional causal analysis through EMD provides a valuable framework for examining the nonlinear relationships among financial assets, offering insights into Bitcoin's potential as a diversification tool in certain periods within GCC stock markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Cryptocurrency; Empirical mode decomposition; GCC economy; Multiresolution pattern recognition; Predictive analytics; Stock markets","Bitcoin; Financial markets; Pattern recognition; Predictive analytics; Analytical methodology; Different frequency; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Frequency scale; Gulf Cooperation Council; Gulf cooperation council economy; Gulf cooperation council stock market; Intrinsic Mode functions; Multiresolution; Multiresolution pattern recognition; Empirical mode decomposition","","","","","","","Chandar S.K., Hybrid models for intraday stock price forecasting based on artificial neural networks and metaheuristic algorithms, Pattern Recognit.

To do so, monthly data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (THT) from January 2021 to April 2023 were employed. We utilized quantile regression and Granger causality analysis to investigate the relationship between EPU and cryptocurrencies. The initial results of this study suggest that EPU has little effect on the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. To enhance the strength and validity of these findings, we performed separate evaluations tailored to the unique contexts of the United States and China. The results revealed that the effects of EPU were adverse and statistically insignificant for China, while the situation differed slightly for the United States. Given that the United States has the most developed economy, its policies have a significant influence globally. As a result, cryptocurrencies have the potential to serve as efficient hedging tools. Furthermore, we incorporated nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) analysis to assess the asymmetric impact of EPU on cryptocurrencies by adopting both short-term and long-term perspectives. The outcomes demonstrated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum can serve as hedging tools in the short-term, although this utility diminishes in the long-term. Conversely, Tether displayed a positive association with EPU in the long-term. The findings of this study hold significance for policy-makers, offering valuable insights related to structuring efficient policies. The recommendations include fostering a rational framework for active participation from various stakeholders, including investors, governmental bodies, central banks, stock exchanges, and financial institutions. This collaborative effort aims to mitigate irrational fluctuations and enhance the acceptability of cryptocurrencies. In essence, this research underscores the potential of cryptocurrencies as a secure hedge against short-term EPU. However, we caution against assuming that any single cryptocurrency can consistently serve as a dependable investment haven. © 2024, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Almeida J., Goncalves T.C., Portfolio diversification, hedge and safe-haven properties in cryptocurrency investments and financial economics: a systematic literature review, J Risk Financ Manag, 16, 1, (2022); Almeida J., Goncalves T.C., A systematic literature review of investor behavior in the cryptocurrency markets, J Behav Exp Finance, 37, 2023, (2023); Alpago H., Bitcoin’den Selfcoin’e kripto para, Uluslararası Bilimsel Araştırmalar Dergisi (IBAD), 3, 2, pp. 411-428, (2018); Ammous S., Can cryptocurrencies fulfil the functions of money?, Q Rev Econd Financ, 70, pp. 38-51, (2018); Arize A.C., Malindretos J., Igwe E.U., Do exchange rate changes improve the trade balance: An asymmetric nonlinear cointegration approach, International Review of Economics & Finance, 49, pp. 313-326, (2017); Aysan D.G., Lau, Aysan A.F., Demir E., Gozgor G., Lau C.K.M., Effects of the geopolitical risks on Bitcoin returns and volatility, Res Int Bus Financ, 47, pp. 511-518, (2019); Balcilar M., Elsayed A.H., Hammoudeh S., Financial connectedness and risk transmission among MENA countries: evidence from connectedness network and clustering analysis, J Int Financ Market Institut Money, 82, (2023); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Q J Econ, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Bialkowski J., Cryptocurrencies in institutional investors’ portfolios: evidence from industry stop-loss rules, Econ Lett, 191, (2020); Bouri E., Gupta R., Tiwari A.K., Roubaud D., Does Bitcoin hedge global uncertainty?

While this metaphor has been subject to discursive and ideological critique within media, communication and cultural studies, this article conducts a materialist analysis of the connections between data and oil. While claims that data is the new oil typically assume digital technologies to be clean, renewable and sustainable, an infrastructural approach reveals the vast quantities of oil and other fossil fuels necessary for digital capitalism, therefore repudiating claims that data can grow exponentially with no material costs. Consequently, the article explores how metabolic rifts and degrowth offer productive frameworks for outlining the contours of a sustainable and equitable digital future. © The Author(s) 2021.","Advertising; bitcoin; data; data colonialism; data is the new oil; data mining; degrowth; extractivism; infrastructure; metabolic rift","","","","","","","","Amoore L., Cloud Ethics: Algorithms and the Attributes of Ourselves and Others, (2020); Anderson C., The end of theory: the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete, Wired, (2008); Andrae A.S., Edler T., On global electricity usage of communication technology: trends to 2030, Challenges, 6, pp. 117-157, (2015); iPhone 11 environmental report, (2019); Mac Pro environmental; report, (2019); Arboleda M., Planetary Mine: Territories of Extraction Under Late Capitalism, (2020); Exporting harm, the high-tech trashing of Asia, (2002); Bastani A., Fully Automated Luxury Communism, (2019); Beer D., Productive measures: culture and measurement in the context of everyday neoliberalism, Big Data & Society, 2, pp. 1-12, (2015); Beer D., Metric Power, (2016); Bhageshpur K., Data is the new oil – and that’s a good thing, Forbes, (2019); Bonneuil C., Fressoz J.-B., The Shock of the Anthropocene: The Earth, History and Us, (2016); Bowker G.C., Memory Practices in the Sciences, (2005); Brevini B., Black boxes, not green: mythologizing artificial intelligence and omitting the environment, Big Data & Society, 7, pp. 1-5, (2020); Bridle J., New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future, (2018); Brodie P., Climate extraction and supply chains of data, Media, Culture & Society, 42, pp. 1095-1114, (2020); Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, (2021); Capital S., Data is the new oil.. who’s going to own it?, Financial Times, (2016); Caraway B.R., Literal media ecology: crisis in the conditions of production, Television & New Media, 19, pp. 486-503, (2018); Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society: The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture Volume I, (1996); Couldry N., Mejias U.A., The Costs of Connection: How Data Is Colonizing Human Life and Appropriating It for Capitalism, (2019); Couldry N., Yu J., Deconstructing datafication’s brave new world, New Media & Society, 20, 4, pp. 4473-4491, (2018); Crawford K., Joler V., Anatomy of an AI System-The Amazon Echo as an anatomical map of human labor, data and planetary resources, AI Now Institute and Share Lab, (2018); Cubitt S., Finite Media: Environmental Implications of Digital Technologies, (2016); Cubitt S., Hassan R., Volkmer I., Does cloud computing have a silver lining?, Media, Culture & Society, 33, pp. 149-158, (2011); Curtis M., Web of Deceit: Britain’s Real Role in the World, (2003); Dazhou Y., Siemens process, Handbook of Photovoltaic Silicon, pp. 1-32, (2017); Dean J., Democracy and Other Neoliberal Fantasies: Communicative Capitalism and Left Politics, (2009); The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data, The Economist, (2017); Farrier D., Anthropocene Poetics: Deep Time, Sacrifice Zones, and Extinction, (2019); Fisher M.M., Kingsbury T., An Industry Full of Potential: Ten Facts to Know About Plastics from Consumer Electronics -2003 Update, (2003); Forti V., Balde C.P., Kuehr R., Et al., The Global E-waste Monitor 2020: Quantities, Flows and the Circular Economy Potential, (2020); Foster J.B., Clark B., York R., The Ecological Rift: Capitalism’s War on the Earth, (2011); Gabrys J., Program Earth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet, (2016); Geyer R., Jambeck J.R., Law K.L., Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made, Science Advances, 3, (2017); Gitelman L., Raw Data Is an Oxymoron, (2013); Greenfield A., Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life, (2017); Gregg M., Inside the data spectacle, Television & New Media, 16, pp. 37-51, (2015); Guo P., Xu X., Huang B., Et al., Blood lead levels and associated factors among children in Guiyu of China: a population-based study, PLoS ONE, 9, 8, (2014); Hardt M., Negri A., Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire, (2005); Harvey D., A Brief History of Neoliberalism, (2005); Haskins C., Airpods Are a Tragedy.

Design/methodology/approach: We used an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for panel data and performed robustness checks by utilizing a random effect model (REM) and generalized method of moments (GMM). There are 25 most adopted cryptocurrency’s countries and the data spans from 22 March 2021 to 6 May 2022. Findings: This research discovered four findings: (1) the index of COVID-19 vaccine confidence (VCI) recovers the economic and Bitcoin has become more attractive, causing investors to shift their investment from Dogecoin to Bitcoin. However, the VCI was revealed to be insignificant to Ripple; (2) during uncertain times, Bitcoin could perform as a diversifier, while Ripple could behave as a diversifier, safe haven or hedge. Meanwhile, the movement of Dogecoin prices tended to be influenced by public figures’ actions; (3) public opinion on Twitter and government policy changes regarding COVID-19 and economy had a crucial role in investment decision making; and (4) the COVID-19 variants revealed insignificant results to payment-based system cryptocurrency returns. Originality/value: This study contributed to verifying the vaccine confidence index effect on payment-based system cryptocurrency returns. Also, we further investigated the uncertainty indicators impacting on cryptocurrency returns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we utilized the COVID-19 variants as a cryptocurrency returns’ new determinant. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ARDL panel; COVID-19; Cryptocurrency; Economic uncertainty; Payment-based system; Vaccine confidence index","COVID-19; decision making; electronic commerce; financial market; financial system; Internet; investment; performance assessment; uncertainty analysis; vaccine","","","","","","","Adedokun A., Bitcoin-altcoin price synchronization hypothesis: evidence from recent data, Journal of Finance and Economics, 7, 4, pp. 137-147, (2019); Aharon D.Y., Demir E., Lau C.K.M., Zaremba A., Twitter-based uncertainty and cryptocurrency returns, Research in International Business and Finance, 59, (2022); Arellano M., Bond S., Some tests of specification for panel data: monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Kost K., Sammon M.C., Viratyosin T., The unprecedented stock market impact of COVID-19, (2020); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Renault T., Twitter-derived measures of economic uncertainty, (2021); Banerjee A.K., Akhtaruzzaman M., Dionisio A., Almeida D.M., Sensoy A., Nonlinear nexus between cryptocurrency returns and COVID–19 news sentiment, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 36, (2022); Bernal J.L., Andrews N., Gower C., Gallagher E., Simmons R., Thelwall S., Stowe J., Tessier E., Groves N., Dabrera G., Myers R., Effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against the B. 1.617. 2 (Delta) variant, New England Journal of Medicine, 385, 7, pp. 585-594, (2021); Bloom D., Canning D., Health as human capital and its impact on economic performance, The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 28, 2, pp. 304-315, (2003); Bouri E., Demirer R., Gupta R., Pierdzioch C., Infectious diseases, market uncertainty and oil market volatility, Energies, 13, 15, (2020); Bouri E., Demirer R., Gupta R., Nel J., Covid-19 pandemic and investor herding in international stock markets, Risks, 9, 9, (2021); Bouri E., Gkillas K., Gupta R., Pierdzioch C., Forecasting power of infectious diseases-related uncertainty for gold realized variance, Finance Research Letters, 42, (2021); Brown C.C., Young S.G., Pro G.C., COVID-19 vaccination rates vary by community vulnerability: a county-level analysis, Vaccine, 39, 31, pp. 4245-4249, (2021); Buckman S.R., Shapiro A.H., Sudhof M., Wilson D.J., News sentiment in the time of COVID-19, FRBSF Economic Letter, 8, (2020); Burki T.K., Omicron variant and booster COVID-19 vaccines, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 10, 2, (2022); Busu M., Analyzing the impact of the renewable energy sources on economic growth at the EU level using an ARDL model, Mathematics, 8, 8, (2020); Chen C., Liu L., Zhao N., Fear sentiment, uncertainty, and bitcoin price dynamics: the case of COVID-19, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 56, 10, pp. 2298-2309, (2020); Chowdhury M.I.H., Agyemang A., Gregory-Allen R.B., Larcher B., Impact of market volatility on investor sentiment: evidence from COVID-19 and crypto-currencies, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2021); Ciaian P., Rajcaniova M., Kancs D.A., Virtual relationships: short- and long-run evidence from Bitcoin and Altcoin markets, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 52, pp. 173-195, (2018); Coulibaly S., COVID-19 policy responses, inflation and spillover effects in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, African Development Review, 33, S1, pp. S139-S151, (2021); Datta S.C., Potential policy-developed global-COVID-19-vaccine: enriched medical sciences and technology green-socio-economy, Cross Current International Journal of Medical and Biosciences, 2, 10, pp. 143-154, (2020); Demir E., Gozgor G., Lau C.K.M., Vigne S.A., Does economic policy uncertainty predict the Bitcoin returns?

The key moment was the introduction of virtual currencies into monetary systems and payment turnover. The circulation of cryptocurrencies along with fiat money in the global economy has created paradoxical situations that require research both scientific, theoretical and applied context. The subject of the study is the payment functionality of digital currencies. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibility of using cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for cross-border payments within the existing traditional financial system, both in the general context and with the application of sanctions restrictions that hamper international settlements in traditional methods. In the process of research, content analysis, retrospective analysis, methods of logical and comparative analysis were used. This study is one of the first to explore the possibility of using bitcoin in cross-border payments under sanctions restrictions. It is shown that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is the most important characteristic that limits their use as payment instruments, but this risk can be neutralized by using cryptocurrency as a transit instrument, as a temporary intermediary in the exchange of fiat currencies. The conclusion is made about the possibility of using cryptocurrencies as a transit instrument in the implementation of exports and imports settlements in toxic currencies of unfriendly countries, and to use the Central Bank Digital Currencies in cross-border settlements within the framework of integration and non-integration interstate associations with the participation of Russia. © Krylova L.V., 2024.","bitcoin; CBDC; cross-border payments; cryptocurrencies; digital currencies; fiat currencies","","","","","","","","LocalBitcoins ceased operations, it banned the registration of new accounts, and on February 16 stopped trading and limited the functions of the wallet, leaving only the withdrawal of funds; Cryptocurrencies: trends, risks, measures.

Unfortunately, in emerging African countries, few studies conducted on volatility spillovers failed to adequately establish the significance and pattern of volatility spillover effects between returns on Bitcoin, stock markets and exchange rates. Hence, the need for this study using the diagonal-BEKK approach. While Botswana had an inverse pattern of spillovers, Tunisia had a positive pattern. Bitcoin and stock prices both had volatility spillover effects between each other in South Africa. South Africa and Namibia were the only countries with significant volatility spillovers between stock prices and exchange rates. In countries like Kenya that had significant cross-volatility from the stock market to the exchange rate, news about the stock market stimulated reactions from investors that impacted volatility within the market. This volatility creates a multiplier effect on other economic circles of influence, depending on whether reactions are favourable to the market or unfavourable. When volatility in the Kenyan stock market rises, exchange rates in the next period experience less volatility, against the common theory that investors’ actions that cause volatility in the stock market cause withdrawal of investments. © 2024 The Authors.","BEKK-GARCH; Bitcoin; Crypto-Currency; Emerging African Countries; Stock Market; Volatility Spillover","","","","","","Edo State University Uzairue","The Authors owe a strong appreciation to Dr. Idris Abubakar, Dr. Wilfred Olley and Prof. Godwin A.

Design/methodology/approach: This research analyzes the impact of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and Ripple) on the gold, WTI, VIX index, G7 and the BRICS index before and during COVID-19, using the quantile regression approach for the 2016–2020 period. In addition, to catch long- and short-run asymmetries of cryptocurrencies on aforementioned dependent variables, an asymmetric nonlinear co-integration (nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag [NARDL]) approach is applied. Findings: The result of the quantile regression shows that in a high market, which corresponds to the 90th quantile, the FTSE MIB, CAC40, SSE, BSE 30, and BVSP stock market showed a statistically insignificant negative coefficient, on the Bitcoin price. In a middle and low markets, which correspond to the 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5th quantiles, the BVSP, FTSE MIB, S&P/TSX, SSE and Nikkei stock markets show statistically significant and positive on Bitcoin. Evidence from the NARDL shows a statistically significant positive impact of cryptocurrencies on the gold, WTI, VIX index, G7 and BRICS indices before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: These results can provide investors with valuable analysis and information and help them make the best decisions and adopt the best strategies. Therefore, future investigations may concentrate and examine the monetary and governmental policies to be adapted to face the COVID-19 pandemic’s dangerous effects on both the society and the economy. For this reason, investors should take this into account when making their asset allocation decisions. Moreover, the portfolio managers, such as index funds, may consider few eligible cryptocurrencies for their inclusion into the portfolio. However, the speculators present in both stock and crypto markets may opt for a spread strategy to improve their portfolio returns. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asymmetric; COVID-19; Cryptocurrency; NARDL; Quantile regression; Safe haven; Stock index","","","","","","","","Al-Yahyaee K.H., Rehman M.U., Mensi W., Al-Jarrah I.M.W., Can uncertainty indices predict Bitcoin prices?

The preliminary results confirmed that by spreading the coronavirus, the sensitivity of the green bond market has increased to the gold index. In addition, the green cryptocurrency index (Cardano) significantly impacts green bonds more during the Corona era. The negative effect of the Bitcoin index on the index of green bonds in the Corona era is less than its adverse effect in the pre-corona period. Developing green cryptocurrencies and linking cryptocurrencies and digital green financing are two significant recommended policy implications for scholars and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain technology; Cryptocurrencies; Green bonds; Green resource finding","Bitcoin; Energy policy; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Adverse effect; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Coronaviruses; Daily datum; Green bond; Green resource finding; Policy implications; Regression method; Seemingly unrelated regression; alternative energy; COVID-19; economic policy; energy resource; environmental technology; green economy; market; resource economy; Blockchain","","","","","Blockchain Technology, (AXYJ2022-002); Sichuan Institute of International Science and Technology Cooperation; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2020JDR0174); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program","This research is funded by Sichuan Science and Technology Program : Research on the Deep Integration of Technology and Finance for Medical and Pension Mutual Assistance System Based on Blockchain Technology ( 2020JDR0174 ), and Sichuan Institute of International Science and Technology Cooperation (Australia and New Zealand) Major Program: Research on Australian Financial Regulatory System and Innovation Supported by Blockchain Technology ( AXYJ2022-002 ).","Gylfason T., Natural resources, education, and economic development, Eur.

Recently, investments in instruments such as stocks, bitcoins and in real estate are seen as decisive factors that intensify the polarization of wealth in South Korea. The motivation for this study is to analyze effects of investment on polarization of wealth. We carried out a study focused on the impact of investments on the polarization of wealth. In this study, we analyzed the effect of investment on the polarization of wealth. We studied the effect of real estate, stocks, and bitcoin on the polarization of wealth. We conducted multiple regression analysis on the income quintile share ratio, real estate, stocks, and bitcoins and then carry out multiple regression analysis with interest rates, household debt, incomes, and price indices. In order to analyze the investment impact on the polarization of wealth, the public data (2015–2020) from the government and institutions were utilized. Results showed that real estate, stocks, and bitcoins set as investment instruments in this study did not have a significant impact on the polarization of wealth. It is because the popularity of investments in real estates, stocks, and bitcoins in South Korea began in earnest from 2020, and has actually accelerated the polarization of wealth. This study has the theoretical contribution because the impact of investments on the polarization of wealth is analyzed, and policies for economic stability are discussed and presented. In addition, a new academic contribution of this study is to analyze the investment and polarization of wealth at the same time. © 2024 The Author","Economy policy; Effect; Investment; Polarization; South Korea; Wealth","","","","","","Kyonggi University, KGU","This work was supported by Kyonggi University Research Grant 2021.","Agnello L., Sousa R.M., Fiscal adjustments and income inequality: a first assessment, Appl.

Given the potential access it provides to those outside the traditional banking system, Bitcoin proponents – most notably Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele – have touted the ability of Bitcoin to promote “economic freedom,” poverty alleviation, and development in the country. In the rural coastal community of El Zonte, Bitcoin has been pioneered as a tool for everyday transactions and social programs targeting the town's majority poor population. As Bitcoin enthusiasts have flocked to El Zonte, inspired by the imaginary of a Bitcoin-friendly paradise, these mostly White crypto tourists from the Global North have bought up land, patronized exclusive hotels and resorts, and rebranded the town as “Bitcoin Beach.” Drawing on the case study of El Zonte, this article unpacks the material implications and contradictions of Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. I argue that while Bitcoin has created some opportunities for small-scale aid and the business sector, these benefits are limited and largely undermined by the uneven and neocolonial impacts of crypto on local people, land and resources, and power. Situating the findings from El Zonte within a broader discursive and political analysis of Bitcoin legalization in El Salvador, the paper warns of the ways in which crypto facilitates novel forms of territorial, resource, and political control, while reproducing many of the uneven dynamics of neoliberal economic development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; Crypto tourism; Crypto-colonialism; El Salvador; Uneven development","El Salvador [Central America]; banking; colonialism; economic impact; economic reform; political economy; poverty alleviation; rural population; uneven development","","","","","Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium, PSGC; American Association of Geographers, AAG; Nature Society Working Group at Penn State University; NSF National Research Trainee Program LandscapeU, (1828822)","Funding text 1: I would like to thank Dr. Brian King, the Nature Society Working Group at Penn State University, and the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Despite the global climate agenda, coal remains a key energy source for economic growth as it is the dominant fuel for power generation globally. At the same time, the unprecedented growth in the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies has put extra pressure on this market as the mining process consumes vast amounts of energy fuelled predominantly by coal. Hypothesizing that there is a causal link in the direction of coal prices from Bitcoin mining activities due to its effect on electricity consumption, we utilize static and time-varying Granger causality tests to explore the causal linkages between Bitcoin electricity consumption and coal prices as the issue has significant implications for economic development. The results reveal a time-varying causal link from the coal price to Bitcoin mining electricity consumption, suggesting that the coal price is in fact a constraint on mining activities. At the same time, as hypothesized, the evidence in the opposite direction is found to be even stronger, suggesting that electricity consumption from Bitcoin mining activities impacts the coal price. This interplay suggests that electricity consumption from Bitcoin mining activities may be larger than current estimates, highlighting the importance of policy mechanisms to mitigate the possible negative effects on the economy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Commodity markets; Crypo-currency market; Time-varying granger causality","Bitcoin; Coal deposits; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Financial markets; Mining; Statistical tests; Commodities market; Crypo-currency market; Currency markets; Electricity-consumption; Fuel markets; Fuel prices; Granger Causality; Mining activities; Time varying; Time-varying granger causality; coal supply; commodity market; currency; fossil fuel; Granger causality test; price dynamics; Coal","","","","","","","Arora V., Shi S., Energy consumption and economic growth in the United States, Appl.

Daily data are from January 11, 2016 to February 12, 2024, and the methods employed include quantile-on-quantile return connectedness (QQC), cross-quantilogram (CQ), and Granger causality in quantiles (GC), which allow us to make inferences about the safe-haven ability of green bonds. The QQC results establish that the connectedness at directly related quantiles is more pronounced than those of inversely related quantiles for all cases. The degree of return connectedness is highest with conventional bonds, followed by gold and stocks. Green bonds act as the net transmitter of spillover shocks to Bitcoin and gold markets, whereas it serves as the receiver of shocks from the remaining markets. The CQ results indicate that positive returns in green bonds significantly follow negative returns in conventional bonds 5 days later, suggesting that green bonds have a one-week lagged safe-haven ability. The GC from green bonds is bidirectional and mostly intensified in extreme quantiles with oil, cryptocurrencies, and conventional stocks, but unidirectional and visible with Islamic stocks during market downturns. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; crude oil; Ethereum; Gold; Green and conventional bonds; Islamic and conventional stocks; Quantiles; Safe-haven","Commerce; Investments; gold; petroleum; Gold; Gold coverings; Gold market; Granger Causality; Green and conventional bond; Islamic and conventional stock; Market condition; Market situation; Quantile; Safe-haven; crude oil; financial market; gold; green economy; market conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; comparative study; controlled study; cryptocurrency; financial market; price; stock market; commercial phenomena; investment","","gold, 7440-57-5; petroleum, 8002-05-9","","","","","Abakah E.J.A., Tiwari A.K., Ghosh S., Dogan B., Dynamic effect of Bitcoin, fintech and artificial intelligence stocks on eco-friendly assets, Islamic stocks and conventional financial markets: another look using quantile-based approaches, Technol.

Specifically, it establishes how cryptocurrency has been changing the nature of transnational and domestic money laundering (ML). It then assesses the effectiveness of conventional anti-money laundering (AML) policy and legislation against the proliferation of crypto laundering, using Canada as a critical case study. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from court cases and secondary sources to build cross-case trends of cryptocurrency use in ML. Illicit International Political Economy forms the theoretical foundation for this study, whose contribution is situated in the current literature on crypto-ML. Findings: This study finds that Bitcoin is common among crypto-money launderers, though most also use some form of alt-coin, and that the use of third-party currency exchanges is a prevalent method to create illicit funds and conceal proceeds of crime. The findings validate two hypotheses that illicit use of crypto is prevalent in the first two stages of ML, and that crypto is most often used in conjunction with other fiat currencies. Although law enforcement is improving on monitoring and understanding popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, alt-coins pose a significant challenge for criminal intelligence. New regulations for third-party currency exchanges are having a positive impact on curtailing crypto-laundering but are shown to be insufficient per se to contain the use of crypto in criminal activity. Originality/value: This study contributes to a more robust understanding of the use of virtual currency in transnational and domestic ML. It contributes to an emerging body of literature on the role of technological change in enabling the global flow of illicit funds. It also informs public policy on virtual currency in general, and on AML regulation in Canada in particular. © 2020, Christian Leuprecht, Caitlyn Jenkins and Rhianna Hamilton.","Canada; Cryptocurrency; FATF; Money laundering; Transnational crime; USA","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (435-2019-1333, 435-2022-0862); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding: Research for this article was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Insight Grants 435-2022-0862 and 435-2019-1333.","Abudulai S., Amendments to the proceeds of crime (money laundering) and terrorist financing act, (2019); Adachi D., Aoyagi J., Blockchain and economic transactions, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology, pp. 9-22, (2020); Albrecht C., Duffin K.M.K., Hawkins S., Morales Rocha V.M., The use of cryptocurrencies in the money laundering process, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 22, 2, pp. 210-216, (2019); Andreas P., Review: Illicit international political economy: the clandestine side of globalization, Review of International Political Economy, 11, 3, pp. 641-652, (2004); Arasasingham A., DiPippo G., Cryptocurrency’s role in the Russia-Ukraine crisis, (2022); Barone R., Masciandaro D., Organized crime, money laundering and legal economy: theory and simulations, European Journal of Law and Economics, 32, 1, pp. 115-142, (2011); Beare M., Schneider S., Money Laundering in Canada: chasing Dirty and Dangerous Dollars, (2007); Campbell-Verduyn M., Laundering governance, Crime, Law and Social Change, 69, 2, pp. 283-305, (2018); Chohan U.W., Assessing the differences in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency legality across national jurisdictions, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2017); Cooper T., Stack R., A recent overview of anti-money laundering organizations within the United States, Canada and internationally, Journal of Management Policy and Practice, 19, 3, (2018); National criminal intelligence estimate on the Canadian criminal marketplace: money laundering and fraud, (2020); Cullen A., Commission of inquiry into money laundering November 23, 2020, (2020); Cullen A., Commission of inquiry into money laundering in British Columbia final report, (2022); Custers B., Oerlemans J.J., Pool R., Laundering the profits of ransomware; money laundering methods for vouchers and cryptocurrencies, European Journal of Crime, Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, 28, 2, pp. 121-152, (2020); Desmond D.B., Lacey D., Salmon P., Evaluating cryptocurrency laundering as a complex socio-technical system: a systematic literature review, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 22, 3, pp. 480-497, (2019); Ducas E., Wilner A., The security and financial implications of blockchain technologies: regulating emerging technologies in Canada, International Journal: Canada's Journal of Global Policy Analysis, 72, 4, pp. 538-562, (2017); Dupuis D., Gleason K., Money laundering with cryptocurrency: open doors and the regulatory dialectic, Journal of Financial Crime, 28, 1, pp. 60-74, (2021); Dyntu V., Dykyi O., Cryptocurrency in the system of money laundering, Baltic Journal of Economic Studies, 4, 5, pp. 75-81, (2018); Egan M., A bit(coin) of a problem for the EU AML framework, The Palgrave Handbook of Criminal and Terrorism Financing Law, pp. 183-208, (2018); Farrugia S., Ellul J., Azzopardi G., Detection of illicit accounts over the Ethereum blockchain, Expert Systems with Applications, 150, (2020); Ferwerda J., van Saase A., Unger B., Getzner M., Estimating money laundering flows with a gravity model-based simulation, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, pp. 1-11, (2020); Virtual currencies – key definitions and potential AML/CFT risks, (2014); Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures – Canada, (2016); Notice on forthcoming regulatory amendments and flexibility”, Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, (2021); Foley S., Karlsen J.R., Putnins T.J., Sex, drugs, and bitcoin: how much illegal activity is financed through cryptocurrencies?, The Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, (2019); German P.M., Dirty money: an independent review of money laundering in lower mainland casinos conducted for the attorney general of British Columbia, (2018); German P.M., ), turning the tide – an independent review of money laundering in B.C.

To do so, we develop a new concept of “exceedance co-kurtosis” which allows us to quantify asymmetry in strong comovement between each cryptocurrency and the inflation expectation rate. The key findings are as follows. First, we show the change in the co-kurtosis asymmetry for major cryptocurrencies: the downside co-kurtosis was higher than the upside co-kurtosis but it decreased after the reopening of the economy. Although the unconditional correlations between cryptocurrencies and the inflation expectation rates remain very low, our results indicate that the major cryptocurrencies become a slightly better inflation hedge after the reopening. Second and more interestingly, the results do not depend on whether a cryptocurrency has a cap on maximum supply or not. Therefore, treating the major cryptocurrencies as digital commodities could be misleading from the viewpoint of portfolio optimization. © 2023","Bitcoin; Covid-19 crisis; Ethereum; Litecoin; Portfolio optimization","","","","","","","","Alcock J., Satchell S., Asymmetric Dependence in Finance: Diversification, Correlation and Portfolio Management in Market Downturns, (2018); Andrei D., Hasler M., Investor attention and stock market volatility, Rev.

The method is to compare the agents’ and bank's Cobb Douglas utilities over two periods. The conclusions are that the bank prefers to print fiat money to a certain extent. Fiat money printing benefits the borrower/buyer which prefers inflation, benefits the bank if not excessive, and hurts the seller and nontraders. The seller and nontraders prefer a hard money economy or a fiat economy where the bank withdraws money to ensure deflation. More nontraders decrease inflation since the bank's money printing gets spread across more agents.

We explore the long-term relationship between USDI and Bitcoin by estimating a Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) model with two regimes. Thus, the data used cover the period from 18 January 2010 to 30 June 2017 for both USDI and Bitcoin. The empirical findings based on the analysis of the MS-AR model report that investing in Bitcoin involves more benefits than USDI even if the economy is in a recession. However, by examining Bitcoin and USDI volatility, the research findings underline positive dependency between the two. Such results denote that Bitcoin does not act as a hedge, and not even as a safe haven, against USDI. We found that Bitcoin is merely a diversifier for USDI. Accordingly, the outcomes will help investors and portfolio risk managers to make more up-to-date investment analyses and decisions. © 2020 IMI.","Bitcoin; diversifier; hedge; Markov regime-switching; safe Haven; USDI","","","","","","","","Aalborg H.A., Molnar P., de Vries J.E., What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 255-265, (2018); Aftab M., Shah S.Z.A., Ismail I., Does gold act as a hedge or a safe haven against equity and currency in Asia, Global Business Review, 20, 1, pp. 105-118, (2018); Bai J., Perron P., Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes, Econometrica, 66, pp. 47-78, (1998); Baur D.G., Hong K., Lee A.D., Bitcoin: Medium of exchange or speculative assets, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 54, pp. 177-189, (2018); Baur D., Hong K., Lee A., Bitcoin: Currency or asset, (2015); Bouri E., Jalkh N., Molnar P., Roubaud D., Bitcoin for energy commodities before and after the December 2013 crash: Diversifier, hedge or safe haven?, Applied Economics, 49, pp. 5063-5073, (2017); Bouri E., Molnar P., Azzi G., Roubaud D., Hagfors I., On the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier, Finance Research Letters, 20, pp. 192-198, (2017); Briere M., Oosterlinck K., Szafarz A., Virtual currency, tangible return: Portfolio diversification with bitcoin, Journal of Asset Management, 16, pp. 365-373, (2015); Conlon T., McGee R., Safe have or risky hazard?

Accordingly, this study investigates the influence of Bitcoin's energy consumption (BEC), as a representative of the cryptocurrency market, on the regional green economy indices of the United States, Europe, and Asia. Utilizing both unfiltered and filtered data, we conduct empirical analyses from both static and dynamic perspectives to account for the causal relationships that emerged during critical market developments, employing novel algorithms including forward recursive, rolling windows, and recursive rolling. The results reveal that energy-related developments play a dominant role in shaping the causal link between BEC and the green economy performance. More specifically, events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and China's ban on cryptocurrency mining appear to significantly drive casual effects. After filtering out the impacts of global equity markets and information technology developments, we observe even more pronounced impacts on these causal relationships. Our findings highlight the need for coordinated global actions to address the energy consumption of the cryptocurrency market, facilitating the transition to global sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Cryptocurrency mining; Energy consumption; Environmental concerns; Global sustainability; Green economy; Renewable energy","Asia; China; COVID-19; Electricity; Environmental Policy; Europe; Sustainable Development; United States; Green development; Sustainable development goals; Causal relationships; Cryptocurrency mining; Electricity-consumption; Energy-consumption; Environmental concerns; Environmental objectives; Global sustainability; Green economies; Renewable energies; Sustainable investments; algorithm; alternative energy; COVID-19; energy use; equity; financial system; green economy; sustainability; algorithm; Article; Asia; causality; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cryptocurrency; economic aspect; electricity; energy consumption; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; Europe; information technology; investment; pandemic; price; renewable energy; Russian Federation; stock market; Ukraine; United States; war; sustainable development; Green economy","","","","","","","Abakah E.J.A., Tiwari A.K., Ghosh S., Dogan B., Dynamic effect of Bitcoin, fintech and artificial intelligence stocks on eco-friendly assets, Islamic stocks and conventional financial markets: another look using quantile-based approaches, Technol.

Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence based financial management and the creation of new blockchains or cryptocurrencies have transformed the day-to-day operations of economic actors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of financial management and blockchains on environmental sustainability and resource productivity. The monthly time series data of the United States of America economy data is used covering the period from 2000M01–2022M09. Firstly, the stationary variable is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The long-term estimations are investigated through the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares. The findings reveal that artificial intelligence-based financial management helps to improve environmental sustainability and resource productivity by reducing carbon emissions and increasing combustible and renewable waste, metals, and non-metallic minerals resources in the long run. In addition, blockchain technology appears to be a booster for environmental unsustainability while also reducing metallic resources. These findings are particularly important and critical since they indicate the path to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, the findings imply that the United States of America authorities should continue to push AI-based sustainability models and move to green blockchains in order to mitigate the negative environmental effects of blockchains. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Financial management; Natural resources","United States; Artificial intelligence; Bitcoin; Climate change; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Block-chain; Day-to-day operations; Development productivity; Environmental resources; Environmental sustainability; Financial managements; Phillips; Resource productivity; Time-series data; United States of America; comparative study; currency; environmental economics; environmental impact; finance; natural resource; sustainability; Blockchain","","","","","King Saud University, KSU","We appreciate the support of our host institute.

Still, it has not been without negatives resulting from the misuse of modern technologies in commercial transactions illegally, perhaps the most prominent of which is the commission of currency smuggling and money laundering operations through electronic means, which have become one of the major challenges facing countries today. By exploiting modern electronic payment methods, and using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is used to hide the identity of financial assets and make them easily transferable around the world. These currencies provide high confidentiality, making them attractive to criminals. In addition to the use of money transfer platforms, applications such as “Zelle” and “Venmo” are used to transfer illicit funds and hide them across multiple accounts, complicating investigators’ efforts to track the funds. E-commerce platforms are used to conduct quick transactions and hide illicit funds in minutes or even seconds. In addition, some exploit the foreign currency sales window and electronic payment cards to achieve their goals in this area.Since currency smuggling and money laundering have become a major threat to the national economy, they lead to: Decline in purchasing power: Currency smuggling leads to a decrease in the value of the national currency, which causes a decline in the purchasing power of citizens, Increase in poverty and crime: Decline in purchasing power leads to an increase in the poverty rate, which contributes to the spread of crimes such as theft and bribery, in addition to economic losses, as currency smuggling deprives the state of due taxes, which leads to large losses in the state budget, in addition to the occurrence of waves of inflation, as currency smuggling leads to an increase in the prices of goods and services, which increases inflation rates. Therefore, it was necessary for the legislator to develop advanced and flexible legislation aimed at confronting the misuse of means of technological development in currency smuggling and money laundering. It became necessary for the active banking authorities, headed by the central banks, to monitor, follow up and diagnose the new means invented by currency smugglers and money launderers in order to develop instructions and regulations that would limit these suspicious operations and protect the national economy. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

In doing so, we apply a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Auto-Regression (TVP-VAR) model, a dynamic connectedness approach and network analysis. The empirical results indicate that cryptocurrency returns and monetary policy spillovers were particularly large when shadow policy rates became negative, moderated during the Fed's ‘tapering process’, and sharpened again more recently as cryptocurrency buoyancy returned. Gross directional spillovers suggest that shadow policy rates have more ‘to give than to receive’, while those from and to cryptocurrency returns are naturally volatile. There is also strong interconnectedness between monetary policy in either the US or the Eurozone and the UK, and between Bitcoin and Litecoin. However, the spillovers across monetary policy and cryptocurrencies tend to be muted. Finally, spillovers were only slightly larger during the Fed's ‘unconventional’ policy compared to the ‘standard’ era, but their composition qualitatively changed over time. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study explores the contagion and causality dynamics under nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity with Markovian-type regime switches among BT price volatility, EC from BT, and its effects on the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with a daily sample of January 2, 2012–December 24, 2023. In the empirical methodology, following the preliminary tests that indicated nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity, this study employed novel Markov-switching-based nonlinear volatility copula and causality models to capture the marginal distributions of BT, its EC and CO2 emissions, and their joint distributions for contagion and tail dependence and determine nonlinear and asymmetric causality relations in distinct regimes of high and low volatility governed by Markov chains. The empirical results indicate significant and positive copula parameters with high magnitudes demonstrating asymmetric contagion and tail dependence occurring at the extreme levels of BT price volatility in the upper and lower tails during both regimes. Novel Markov-switching-based copula causality tests designated unidirectional causality from BT to CO2, as well as from BT’sECtoCO2 emissions during each regime coupled with existent bidirectional causality confirming cyclical feedback effects between BT prices and its EC in both regimes. For robustness and comparison, single-regime copula models were employed, and their findings confirmed the results concerning significant and positive tail dependence and contagion. However, the single-regime approach led to a set of inconsistencies in causality results owing to omitting nonlinearity while capturing heteroskedasticity and confirming the nonrejection of causality between BT, EC, and CO2 emissions.

Our main finding indicates that while BTC returns respond significantly to changes in electricity consumption, the effect of electricity consumption on ETH returns is negligible. We attribute this discrepancy to BTC's relative energy inefficiency, which contrasts with ETH's commitment to transitioning to a more energy-efficient mining protocol over our sample period. Additionally, we show that the effect of electricity consumption on cryptocurrencies is mitigated by media coverage and policy uncertainty regarding the state of the economy, environment, and cryptocurrency markets. Our results suggest that when trading cryptocurrencies, investors consider their relative energy efficiency and price electricity consumption differently, highlighting the influence of the transition towards more sustainable energy practices on investor preferences and investment decisions in cryptocurrency markets. © 2024","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Energy transition; Ethereum; Sustainable energy practices","Electricity-consumption; Energy transitions; Energy usage; Jump process; Market behaviours; Relative energies; Return volatilities; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy practice; Volatility process; alternative energy; capital market; consumption behavior; decision making; electronic commerce; energy efficiency; energy use; financial market; investment","","","","","Manish Kumar Atree; Paris School of Business Seminar Series","We acknowledge the helpful comments and suggestions from Richard S.J.

First, based on high-frequency data, the paper documents that Bitcoin prices did not immediately respond to US monetary policy announcements in the past; they only started doing so in late 2020, in a manner similar to other risky asset prices. Second, based on a structural VAR analysis I study the impact of monetary policy over longer horizons. I confirm the contractionary impact of a US monetary tightening in the post-2020 time period, but show that, historically, a US tightening used to persistently increase rather than decrease Bitcoin prices. To explain this result, I exploit spreads in Bitcoin valuations across currencies and blockchain data and link increased Bitcoin demand to East Asian economies subject to capital controls, particularly China. I discuss implications for the discussion of where demand for Bitcoin stems from: its recent responses to monetary policy confirm its role as a primarily speculative asset; yet, at least historically Bitcoin seems to have derived part if its value from enabling cross-border value transfers and capital flight. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; Blockchain; High-frequency analysis; Monetary policy; Proxy VAR","","","","","","","","Ahmed S., Akinci O., Queralto A., (2021); Altavilla C., Brugnolini L., Gurkaynak R.S., Motto R., Ragusa G., Measuring euro area monetary policy, J.

Understanding the pattern of Bitcoin's energy consumption and its bubble frequency can greatly enhance policy analysis and decision-making for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction. This research aims to assess the validity of the random walk hypothesis for Bitcoin's electricity consumption and carbon footprint. We employed both traditional methods (ADF and KPSS) and recently proposed unit root techniques that account for structural breaks and non-linearity in the data series. Our analysis covers daily data from July 2010 to December 2021. The empirical results revealed that traditional unit root techniques did not confirm the stationarity of both bitcoin's electricity consumption and carbon footprint. However, novel structural break (SB) and linearity tests conducted enabled us to discover five SB episodes between 2012 and 2020 and non-linearity of the variables, which informed our application of the newly developed non-linear unit root tests with structural breaks. With the new methods, the results indicated stationarity after accommodating the SB and non-linearity. Furthermore, based on Phillips and Shi (2019)'s test, we identified certain bubble episodes in the bitcoin energy and carbon variables between 2013 and 2021. The major drivers of the bubbles in bitcoin energy consumption and carbon footprint are variables relating to the bitcoin and financial markets activities and risks, including the global economic and political risks. The study's conclusion based on the above findings informs several policy implications drawn for energy and environmental management including the encouragement of green investments in cryptocurrency mining and trading. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin carbon footprint; Bitcoin electricity consumption; Energy and environmental policies; Non-linearity; Random walk and bubbles; Structural changes","Carbon; Carbon Footprint; Electricity; Bitcoin; Decision making; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Investments; Methane; Public policy; Random processes; Structural analysis; carbon; Bitcoin carbon footprint; Bitcoin electricity consumption; Electricity-consumption; Energy; Energy and environmental policy; Environmental policy; Non-linearity; Random Walk; Random walk and bubble; Structural change; carbon emission; carbon footprint; energy efficiency; environmental management; policy analysis; article; carbon emission; carbon footprint; cryptocurrency; economic aspect; electricity; energy consumption; environmental policy; financial market; human; investment; mining; random walk; therapy; validity; Carbon footprint","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ","","","","","Adewuyi A.O., Wahab B.A., Adeboye O.S., Stationarity of prices of precious and industrial metals using recent unit root methods: implications for markets' efficiency, Resour.

We show that cryptocurrency exhibits oscillatory and volatile dynamics under certain conditions. We also analyze the welfare and spillover effects of cryptocurrency for different parameter values. Cryptocurrencies may increase welfare for agents in economies with certain parameters, such as those with low relative risk aversion or high output elasticity of capital. Cryptocurrency can easily transfer shocks from one country to another through pricing channels or through propagated risk perception. Our paper contributes to the scarce literature on cryptocurrency in macroeconomic contexts. © 2024 Chulalognkorn University.

Cryptocurrencies are too confusing for laymen and require more investigation. In this study, we analyze the impact that the effective reproductive rate, an epidemiological indicator of the spread of COVID-19, has on both the price and trading volume of eight of the largest digital currencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, and Binance. We hypothesize that as the rate of spread decreases, the trading price of the digital currency increases. Using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models, we find that the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies varies by currency and region. These findings offer novel insight into the cryptocurrency market and the impact that the viral spread of COVID-19 has on the value of the major cryptocurrencies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; COVID-19; Cryptocurrency; Digital currency; Fintech; GARCH","","","","","","","","Aharon D.Y., Umar Z., Vo X.V., Dynamic spillovers between the term structure of interest rates, bitcoin, and safe-haven currencies, Fin Innov, (2021); Alzstyne M.V., Why Bitcoin has value: evaluating the evolving controversial digital currency, Commun ACM, 57, 5, pp. 30-32, (2014); Bhattacharjee S., A statistical analysis of Bitcoin transactions during 2012 to 2013 in terms of premier currencies: Dollar, Euro, and Rubles, Vidwat Ind J Manag, 9, 1, pp. 8-16, (2016); Bohme R., Christin N., Edelman B., Moore T., Bitcoin: economics, technology, and governance, J Econ Perspect, 29, 2, pp. 213-238, (2015); Bollerslev T., Generalized Autorregressive Conditional Heterocedasticity, J Econ, 31, pp. 307-327, (1986); Bondarenko O., Kichuk O., Antonov A., The possibilities of using investment tools based on cryptocurrency in the development of the national economy, Baltic J Econ Stud, 5, 2, pp. 10-17, (2019); Briere M., Oosterlinck K., Szafarz A., Virtual currency, tangible return: portfolio diversification with Bitcoin, J Ass Manag, 16, 6, pp. 365-373, (2015); Bunjaku F., Gjorgieva-Trajkovska O., Miteva-Kacarski E., Cryptocurrencies–advantages and disadvantages, J Econ, 2, 1, pp. 31-39, (2017); Callen-Naviglia J., Alabdan R., Algorithmic economy: a bimodal transformation in U.S. banking, Iss Inf Sys, 17, 2, pp. 9-16, (2016); Carrick J., Bitcoin as a complement to emerging market currencies, Emerg Mark Fin Trade, 52, pp. 2321-2334, (2016); Cheah E., Fry J., Speculative bubbles in bitcoin markets?

Fiat currencies have plummeted as central banks injected too much money into affected economies, and an unprecedented recession has hit the world that central banks and financial institutions are unable to cope with. Bitcoin is a virtual currency whose production is the result of a time-consuming computational activity called exploration. This international currency is not managed by any bank and can be used to buy goods from anywhere in the world, it can also be Traded like stocks or coins. The main purpose of this article is to address the pandemic crisis - COVID 19 and Bitcoin as a virtual currency from the perspective of a user, in addition to goals such as familiarity with Bitcoin for strangers, attracting talented people, and showcasing the capabilities of Bitcoin. It is also covered in the virtual world and e-commerce. This article takes a fresh look at the most known digital currency and, by advancing its goals from the legal and economic perspective of Bitcoin, with a view to the e-commerce COVID 19 pandemic crisis in 2019. This money is a new currency with lower transaction costs than traditional currency markets and operates in a decentralized manner without the presence of intermediaries and regulatory bodies such as the government, banks, and financial institutions, unlike traditional currencies issued by governments. © 2022, Deniz Publication.

In this work, we first compare the K-Nearest Neighbor model, the Artificial Neural Network model, the grey prediction model, and the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) prediction model for a period of data analysis. The experimental results show that LSTM is superior, and thus LSTM model is selected to forecast the long-term prices in this work. Then, we introduce some indicators, such as convergence divergence ratio and risk coefficient to qualitatively analyze the market price. The five-day moving average method is used to formulate the best trading strategy based on the above-introduced indicators. We apply the commonly used regression indicators (R2 and RMSE) to verify the reliability of the prediction model. Then we introduce new strategies to compare the performance of different ones with them. We found that the five-day moving average method achieved 20% higher returns than the other strategies we used for comparison. Considering the fact that transaction costs may change, we perform the polynomial fitting based on existing strategies by changing the commission cost. The results show that a 1% increase in the gold commission will reduce the total return by 24% to 25%, while a 1% increase in the bitcoin commission will only reduce the total return by 7% to 8%.  © 2022 Aihua Gu et al.","","Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Artificial neural network modeling; Empirical research; Inevitable trends; Investment models; K-nearest neighbour models; Memory network; Model-based OPC; Moving average method; Prediction modelling; World economy; Long short-term memory","","","","","Project of Industry and School and Research Institution in Jiangsu Province of China, (BY2021596, BY2022463)","The current study was funded by the Project of Industry and School and Research Institution in Jiangsu Province of China under Grants Nos.

Accordingly, the global economic policy uncertainty has surged due to the resulting spiraling energy prices and economic disruptions. This paper uses a quantile-on-quantile approach to compare the ability of Bitcoin to hedge the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) of major global Bitcoin exchange markets (China, Japan, Korea and the United States) for the periods prior to and post-the COVID-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The results reveal that, prior to the pandemic, significant rises in EPU lead to high Bitcoin returns. After the COVID-19 and the recent war in Ukraine, the hedge effectiveness of Bitcoin is weakening due to the tight correlation with stocks in times of rising inflation expectations and the global central banks' hawkish response to it. Moreover, the Bitcoin hedging property is country-specific, and depends to different Bitcoin market conditions and various uncertainty levels. We explain this heterogeneity by differences across countries in terms of the recognition of Bitcoin as a legal tender, the Bitcoin trading volume, the exchange market maturity, and the investors' attitude towards risk. © (2022), (Economics Bulletin).

This research paper addresses this need by investigating the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, mainly focusing on Bitcoin trend prediction utilizing on-chain data and whale-alert tweets. By employing a Q-learning algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning, we analyze variables such as transaction volume, network activity, and significant Bitcoin transactions highlighted in whale-alert tweets. Our findings indicate that the algorithm effectively predicts Bitcoin trends when integrating on-chain and Twitter data.

Natural language processing was adopted in this study to model data-driven discourses in the crypto-economy, specifically the Bitcoin market. Using topic modelling, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a text analysis of cryptocurrency articles (N = 4218) published from 60 countries in international news media identified key topics associated with cryptocurrency in the international news media from 2018 to 2020. This study provides empirical evidence that across the corpora of international news articles, 18 key topics were framed around the following categorical macro discourses: crypto-related crime, financial governance, and economy and markets. Analysis shows that the identified discourses may have had a social signal' effect on movements in the crypto-financial markets, particularly on Bitcoin's price volatility. Results show these specific discourses proved to have a negative effect on Bitcoin's market price, within 24 h of when the crypto news articles were published. Further, the study found that in some cases, the source of the news may have amplified the volatility effect, particularly in terms of geographical region, relative to broader market conditions. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

Green economy projects are hence losing their focus and competitiveness, endangering the achievement of sustainable development goals and neutrality targets. The study aims to examine the dynamic linkages between the green economy, sustainability, Bitcoin, oil prices and stock markets. We do this by utilizing the daily data from August 2016 to August 2021 for the case of the United States. The recently developed quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) and quantile Granger causality methods are employed for empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that a green economy or green financing from institutions is very sensitive to economic shocks, oil price changes and overall sustainability changes. Similarly, empirical results further reveal that there is a negative association between sustainability with oil prices and sustainability with stock markets; that oil prices and stock markets are also sensitive to sustainability-related shifts. Our study advises investors who want to support sustainable development to include green assets in their portfolios, such as green bonds, which are a good substitute for clean energy or renewable energy stocks. This study reports some fruitful implications apropos of sustainable development goals and a green economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Green economy; Oil prices; Stock markets; Sustainability","United States; Bitcoin; Costs; Financial markets; Investments; Sustainable development; Daily datum; Economic Recession; Energy prices; Energy use; Global economics; Green economies; Oil Prices; Oil stocks; Quantile regression; World energies; COVID-19; currency; environmental economics; green economy; oil supply; stock market; sustainability; sustainable development; COVID-19","","","","","","","Abor P.A., Abor J.Y., Implications of COVID-19 pandemic for health financing system in Ghana, J.

Tracking and regulating digital currency transactions have become a challenging technology for the healthy development of the digital economy. That is because blockchain and peer-to-peer networks are the underlying technologies of digital currencies. Blockchain transaction has some new features, such as stronger anonymity and distributed storage. Therefore, it is difficult for the regulatory system to track the transaction relationships among users. Recent studies have shown that the accuracy, time, and space costs of transaction tracking, as well as the trade-offs between them, still need to be improved. In this article, we propose a new blockchain transaction tracking model called BT2(Bitcoin Transaction Tracking Model). BT2 first combines an improved sampling aggregation algorithm with a graph neural network. And then, it exploits an inductive aggregation method to effectively generate rich node embeddings for a small number of unobserved nodes. Next, the node embedding vectors are used to generate edge information among nodes through message-passing functions. Finally, we can use the edge information to obtain the relations among Bitcoin accounts. This paper evaluates the model on the real-world dataset and explores the impact of various parameters, such as network depth and iteration time, etc. From the experimental results, the model's average AUC (area under the ROC curve) can reach up to 0.93, and the average accuracy is 86%. The numerical results indicate that the performance of BT2 is better than the state of art methods.  © 2013 IEEE.","bitcoin account anonymity; Blockchain; graph neural network; link prediction; transaction tracking","Bitcoin; Economic and social effects; Graph neural networks; Iterative methods; Job analysis; Message passing; Numerical methods; Peer to peer networks; Bitcoin account anonymity; Block-chain; Features extraction; Graph neural networks; Link prediction; Peer-to-peer computing; Task analysis; Transaction tracking; Blockchain","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB1005503)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1005503.","Kruisbergen E.W., Leukfeldt E.R., Kleemans E.R., Roks R.A., Money talks money laundering choices of organized crime offenders in a digital age, J.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed lag (NARDL) approach for the period from November 31, 2013 to December 30, 2020. Findings: The asymmetric effects of inflation, the size of Bitcoin economy, reveal a positive impact on the PB in the short and long run. In the short run, Bitcoin price shows negative statistically significant sensitivity to positive (negative) changes in DJIA (VIX) index. In addition, Google Trends have an impact on Bitcoin prices indicating that the Bitcoin market is also driven by investors' sentiments. In the long run, negative policy uncertainty shocks increase the PB while in the short run, negative shocks decrease it. Originality/value: The authors give credence to the best ways of understanding the existence of asymmetries in the link between the PB and a number of influential macro-finance variables to improve the appropriate asset allocation and portfolio management. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; EPU; Google Trends; Mining; NARDL; Price","","","","","","","","Al-Yahyaee K.H., UrRehman M., Mensi W., Al-Jarrah I.M.W., Can uncertainty indices predict Bitcoin prices?

Extreme increases in asset prices, followed by their sudden decline, create a turbulent effect on the economy and even invite crises in time. For this reason, some measurement techniques have been employed to investigate the price bubbles that may occur. This study explores the possible speculative price bubbles of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin cryptocurrencies, compares them with the pre-and post- COVID-19 period, and examines asymmetric causality relationships between variables. Therefore, we analyzed the price bubbles of these cryptocurrencies using the closing price for daily data between 16.01.2018 and 31.12.2021 by the Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) and the Hatemi-J (2012) asymmetric causality test. In this context, 1446 observations, 723 of which were before COVID-19 and 723 after COVID-19, were employed in the study. Looking at the SADF analysis results, we detected 103 price bubbles before COVID-19 for the three cryptocurrencies, while we determined 599 price bubbles after COVID-19. The common finding in the asymmetric causality test results is that there is a causality relationship between the negative shocks faced by one cryptocurrency and the positive shocks faced by the other cryptocurrencies. © This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.","Asymmetric Causality; COVID-19; price bubbles; SADF","","","","","","","","Aliu F., Nuhiu A., Knapkova A., Lubishtani E., Tran H.

This article retheorizes scams as networked, collective activity. Scams, like all commerce, are shaped by and in turn shape communication channels. The “network scam” is therefore offered as a lens for understanding scams in the digital economy more broadly. As a case study, this article documents the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Bubble. ICOs were supposed to be a new, radically disruptive way of crowdfunding to finance the development of a new, radically disruptive blockchain technological ecosystem. All told, ICOs raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 alone. But by all analyses—both from observers and participants, both during the bubble and after—the vast majority of ICO turned out to be scams. This article uses these scams to theorize the “network scam” as a collaborative effort to bring about a shared future, but one that is fundamentally characterized by arbitrage on uneven belief among participants in that future ever coming to pass. © The Author(s) 2022.","Bitcoin; blockchain; crowdfunding; cryptocurrency; digital economy; Ethereum; Initial Coin Offerings; scams","","","","","","","","Biggart N.W., Charismatic Capitalism: Direct Selling Organizations in America, (1989); Brekke J.K., Postcards from the world of decentralized money: a story in three parts, MoneyLab Reader 2: Overcoming the Hype, pp. 52-63, (2018); Brunton F., Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Utopians, and Technologists Who Created Cryptocurrency, (2019); Brunton F., The long, weird history of the Nigerian e-mail scam, The Boston Globe, (2013); Bryan D., Lee B., Wosnitzer R., Et al., Economics back into cryptoeconomics, Medium.com, (2018); Burrell J., Invisible Users: Youth in the Internet Cafes of Urban Ghana, (2012); Caliskan K., Data money: the socio-technical infrastructure of cryptocurrency blockchains, Economy and Society, 49, 4, pp. 540-561, (2020); Caliskan K., Platform works as stack economization: cryptocurrency markets and exchanges in perspective, Sociologica, 14, 3, pp. 115-142, (2021); Casey M.J., Crypto Winter is here and we only have ourselves to blame, CoinDesk.com, (2018); Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society: The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, 1, (1996); Cermak L., Twitter, (2019); Cheesman M., Self-sovereignty for refugees?

Therefore, to fill this research gap, this paper comprehensively adopts the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC-) GARCH model and wavelet coherence analysis (WTC) to reveal the internal correlation and formation reasons of digital currency price fluctuations. Our research has the following findings: (1) the price fluctuations of digital currency are highly related. Through the observation of the dynamic conditional correlation coefficient graph, it is found that the price fluctuations have a strong time-varying trend, manifested as a ‘contagious’ characteristic. (2) During the outbreak of COVID-19, most digital currencies have shown positive resonance in the short, medium, and long term, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the correlation and contagion of digital currency price fluctuations. (3) In the short term, Bitcoin is the main ‘contagious source’ of digital currency price fluctuation. But in the medium and long term, Ethereum and Ripple, which are closely related to the real economy, have a greater impact and become the new ‘contagious source’. Generally speaking, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are the internal causes of instability in the digital currency market. Finally, based on the empirical conclusion, this paper proposes that the digital currency portfolio should be optimized to meet the investment demand; strengthen digital currency regulatory cooperation, and improve regulatory efficiency. Let the digital currency return to the ‘currency’ attribute and serve the real economy. © 2022 The Author(s).

To understand decision making in cryptocurrency holders, we assessed temporal discounting, that is, whether Bitcoin holders disregard rewards if they are distant in time and overvalue rewards if they are more immediate. Further, we compared performance between short-term investors (i.e., day-traders) vs. long-term investors. Methods: Using an online survey, we invited 144 Bitcoin holders to answer temporal discounting questionnaires dealing with money (“Which do you prefer, that you get right now 20 USD in cash or 100 USD in a month?”) and Bitcoin (“Which do you prefer, that you get right now 0.1 or 1 Bitcoin in a month?”). Results: Analysis demonstrated no significant differences between temporal discounting for money and Bitcoin. However, and critically, higher temporal discounting for both money and Bitcoin was observed in short-term investors compared with long-term investors. In a similar vein, significant positive correlations were observed between day trading and temporal discounting for both money and Bitcoin. Discussion: These findings demonstrate how Bitcoin holders with short-term time horizons tend to prioritize immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards. Future research can assess the neural basis of temporal discounting for cryptocurrencies.

The demonetisation exercise in November 2016 was an attempt to address it. As regulatory measures are taken to tackle UW, criminals identify newer ways to avoid detection, e.g., cryptocurrency usage for illicit activities, as it bypasses formal banking channels. This article examines evidence of change in cryptocurrency usage in the context of demonetisation. This is done by examining four datasets viz. keyword search for bitcoin (BTC), volume of BTC traded in India, price variation between USD/BTC/INR and BTC blockchain transaction dataset. The data indicates heightened awareness of cryptocurrency, increase in volume traded and increase in price spread between BTC/USD/INR, though unable to discern deviation in blockchain dataset due to India led transactions. Increasing BTC usage, given inability to regulate these transactions, supports move by Government of India to ban its usage till the technology and its implications are understood better.

First, it models and forecasts the risk of the five leading cryptocurrencies, stock market indices (developed and BRICS) and gold returns. Second, it conducts different backtesting procedures forecasts. Third, it focuses on the hedging potential of cryptocurrencies and gold. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) models to model and forecast the risk of cryptocurrencies, stock market indices and gold returns. They conduct different backtesting procedures of the 1% and 5%-value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts. They also use the generalized orthogonal generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GO-GARCH) model to explore the hedging potential of cryptocurrencies by estimating the dynamic conditional correlation between cryptocurrencies and gold, on the one hand, and stock markets on the other hand. Findings: When conducting different backtesting procedures of VaR, our finding suggests that Bitcoin has the highest VaR among cryptocurrencies and Gold and the BRICS indices returns have lower VaR compared to the developed countries. Finally, we provide evidence that the risks among developed stock markets can be hedged by Bitcoin and Gold. Bitcoin can be considered as the new Gold for these economies. Unlike Bitcoin, Gold can be considered as a hedge for Chinese and Indian investors. However, Gold and Bitcoin can be considered as diversifier assets for the other BRICS economies while Dash and Monero are diversifier assets for developed stock markets. Originality/value: The first paper's empirical contribution lies in analyzing optimal forecast models for cryptocurrencies (other than Bitcoin) returns and risk. The second contribution consists of studying the hedging potential of five leading cryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of cryptocurrencies for BRICS investors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cryptocurrencies; GAS; GO-GARCH; Gold; Hedging; Stock market indices; VaR","","","","","","","","Aalborg H.A., Molnar P., de Vries J.E., What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin?, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 255-265, (2019); Aslanidis N., Bariviera A.F., Martinez-Ibanez O., An analysis of cryptocurrencies conditional cross correlations, Finance Research Letters, 31, pp. 130-137, (2019); Basher S.A., Sadorsky P., Hedging emerging market stock prices with oil, gold, VIX, and bonds: a comparison between DCC, ADCC and GO-GARCH, Energy Economics, 54, pp. 235-247, (2016); Baur D.G., Dimpfl T., Asymmetric volatility in crypto-currencies, Economic Letters, 173, pp. 1-15, (2018); Baur D.G., Lucey B.M., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

The material for the study was about 1000 new terminological units found in the media sources, the fi rst written recording of which dates back to 2000–2020. The analysis of of new terminological vocabulary in the media of the 21st century showed that the process of terminologization of Russian speech is accompanied by the process of “false” terminologization of modern media, which arises as a result of the wide-spread phenomenon of the “terminological noise”. Terminological noise is defi ned as the background, stylistic fi lling of the media space with special lexis without its further adoption by common language, which consists of at least two trends: (1) using false terminological vocabulary in text and (2) sporadic manifestation of terms in the media and/or their shortterm actualization. First, when studying new special lexis that is functioning in the media, we identified a group of lexis that is perceived as words of special discourse, but functioning exclusively in media discourse — journalistic quasi-terms (quasi... “false, imaginary”), for example, CAR-инженерия (CAR engineering), дамплинг-ион (dumping ion), нейропоэт (neuropoet). Another group of words we identifi ed can be described as terminological newspaperisms, for example, ДНК-детек- тив (DNA detective), CRISPR-эпопея (CRISPR epic), биткоин-лихорадка (bitcoin fever), биткоин-мания (bitcoin-mania), ИИ-пузырь (AI bubble). The second feature we discovered was the fact that media and professional terms and words are used sporadically in media texts, sometimes with high frequency of use over a short period. Thus, based on the collected sample, presumably only about 4–5% of cases are recognized by common language and become the words that “update” the vocabulary of the literary language. These are terms such as графен (graphene), коронавирус (coronavirus), экзопланета (exoplanet), etc. 95% of the sample are cases of terminological noise — journalistic quasi-terms, terminological newspaperisms, terms with a fl ickering frequency. The examples of these include: AI-замок (AI-lock), bitcoin-инвес- тор (bitcoin-investor), CAR-инженерия (CAR-engineering), CRISPR-каскады (CRISPR-cascades), digital-экономика (digital-economy), smart-бизнес (smartbusiness), большой отскок (big rebound), вселесная паутина (omniforestal web), генеративное творчество (generative creativity), ГМ-дрожжи (GM yeast), ИИ-советник (AI-advisor), когнитивное платье (cognitive dress), криспы (crisps), роборыбак (robofi sher). © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences.

Bitcoin offered a decentralized alternative to money, with thousands of other cryptoassets quickly emerging. Most recently, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) promises to offer a new digital economy, with smart contracts replacing the need for financial intermediaries. This new market aims to reinvent traditional financial products in a more transparent and interoperable way. In this paper we aim to undertake an extensive literature review of the financial stability risks posed by the fast-growing DeFi market and assess these using the Financial Stability Board’s fintech framework. We find that DeFi could pose several challenges to traditional financial infrastructure, primarily by increasing interlinkages between cryptoassets and traditional financial markets. However, if DeFi evolves in a safe way, it could increase competition and financial inclusion with overall positive implications for financial stability. © 2022, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

Given this backdrop, this paper investigates the effects of returns in different financial markets, i.e. the United States Treasury Bonds, the Standard & Poor’s stock market, the United States Dollar, Gold, Crude Oil, and Bitcoin on the Green Bond returns (the Standard & Poor’s Green Bond Index) from September 17, 2014, to September 1, 2022. The results from the robust linear and machine learning estimators indicate that the returns of the United States Treasury Bonds and the United States Dollar are negatively related to the Green Bond returns. Meanwhile, Gold returns positively affect Green Bond returns. The quantile regression estimations of Machado–Santos Silva also show that these findings are valid in different quantiles. The paper also discusses policy implications related to climate change and the development of financial instruments to promote green investments. © 2023 The Author(s).

This is to ensure, among other things, market rate behavior, market economics, the implementation and regulation of tax laws, and consumer safety inside the distinctive attributes of the investments, all while encouraging the development of a profitable bitcoin economy. Vietnam is no different, especially as cryptocurrencies are known to be cross-jurisdictional, and as such, supervisory difficulties do not end at state boundaries. Recent developments in Vietnam indicate that they are moving toward cross-jurisdictional regulatory norms to promote regulatory clarity, remove loopholes, and prevent regulatory arbitrage, all while adhering to stringent currency control. There also has been some recent recognition of crypto-based inventions and efficiency in money and trade, notably for cross-border dealings. Some progressive examples in this paper are illustrated to develop dispute resolution mechanisms for e-commerce using new technology. Recommendations are made in respect to the use of viewpoints of a comprehensive cross-section of the Quadratic Voting /Smart Contracts with permission-based blockchain network as useful tools to assist Vietnamese controllers in emerging online dispute mechanisms towards a streamlined e-commerce economy. © The Author(s) 2022.","Blockchain; E-commerce; Legal Framework; Online Dispute Resolution; Quadratic voting; Smart Contracts","","","","","","","","ABERNETHY S., Building large-scale online dispute resolution & Trustmark systems, UNECE Forum on ODR, pp. 50-250, (2003); ALEX G., RheaNet Digital Dispute Resolution Platform for Maritime Trade Finance Powered by Ethereum Chain-link Ecosystem, (2021); ALLEN D., LANE A., POBLET M., The Governance of Blockchain Dispute Resolution, (2019); BERGOLLA L., Kleros: A Socio-Legal Case Study of Decentralized Justice & Blockchain Arbitration, Ohio St. J. on Disp.

Moreover, digital transformations led to the development of cryptocurrency. However, crypto trading provokes a dilemma loop. On the one hand, crypto trading led to economic development, which allowed attracting additional resources to extending smart and green technologies for de-carbonising the economic growth. On the other hand, crypto trading led to intensifying energy sources, which provoked an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. The paper aims to analyse the connec-tions between crypto trading, economic development of the country, renewable energy consump-tion, and environmental degradation. The data for analysis were obtained from: Our World in Data, World Data Bank, Eurostat, Ukrstat, Crystal Blockchain, and KOF Globalisation Index. To check the hypothesis, the paper applied the Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests, FMOLS and DOLS panel cointegration models, and Vector Error Correction Models. The findings concluded that the increasing crypto trading led to enhanced GDP, real gross fixed capital formation, and globalisation. However, in the long run, the relationship between crypto trading and the share of renewable energies in total energy consumption was not confirmed by the empirical results. For further direc-tions, it is necessary to analyse the impact of crypto trading on land and water pollution. © 2022 by the authors.

However, there is lack of research handling cryptocurrencies in a mainstream macroeconomic model. To bridge the gap, we develop a model for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency as risky and costly bubbles in an infinite-horizon production economy. This model is consistent with the following facts: (1) the surging Bitcoin market presents enormous volatility, (2) its price dynamics are significantly sensitive to both market sentiment and policy stances. Entrepreneurial firms choose to hold Bitcoins as liquid assets to buffer idiosyncratic investment distortions. The intrinsically worthless Bitcoins can emerge as rational bubbles when the market sentiment is optimistic enough. On the one hand, bubbly Bitcoins provide market liquidity to facilitate investment in the real sector, while on the other hand, they deteriorate the investment efficiency and crowd out aggregate production. Our quantitative exercise produces various cyclical features of Bitcoin bubbles and find that the collapse of Bitcoin bubbles can improve social welfare by decreasing distortion-driven real investment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asset bubbles; Cryptocurrency; Financial frictions; Market sentiment","","","","","","Guanghua Blockchain Lab; Guanghua Research Fund on FinTech; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (71903126, 72022011, 72122011)","We would like to thank the Editor, the Associate Editor, three anonymous referees, Redouane Elkamhi, Laura Xiaolei Liu, Vincenzo Quadrini, Baolian Wang, Pengfei Wang, Ji Zhang (discussant), Xiaodong Zhu and Yifeng Zhu and the seminar participants at the First Macro-Finance Workshop at Peking University HSBC Business School, Central University of Finance and Economics, and Peking University for their useful discussions and comments.

Besides the economical aspect, the technological capabilities of Blockchain such as distributed computing, record keeping, irrecoverability of transactions, reliability and etc., are harnessed by variety of real-world applications. Blockchain is a rising pool of records known as blocks linked using security procedure. It is typically managed by a group of nodes in a distributed network technology which integrates technologies such as distributed ledger, security and consensus algorithm to ensure reliability and immutability. In Blockchain, the access privileges are determined by a set of nodes called miners, which run the consensus algorithm to access and submit transactions in to the block after authentication. However, in the existing Blockchain, there is no mechanism to ensure the trust and robustness of the miners and eliminate the malicious miners which runs the consensus algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a trust model with an objective of eliminating untrusted nodes from the mining process to enhance the reliability and security of the Blockchain. Further, the proposed trust model is suitably analysed for transaction rate, efficiency and scalability with Hyper Ledger framework to ensure the robustness. © 2022 R.

The purpose of the article is to identify cryptocurrency value formation factors and determine the risks of investing in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is simultaneously considered a currency, an asset with uncertain income, and a specific product, the price of which is determined by the energy costs for mining new cryptocurrency blocks. Thus, the paper examines the risks of investing in cryptocurrency from several positions. First, the study identifies the factors of formation of the value and risk of cryptocurrency as ordinary money based on comparing cryptocurrency with traditional money. Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrency is not tied to the economic performance of a particular country; also, central banks do not control or regulate their mining. Instead, the cryptocurrency emissions depend on the computational capacity of the equipment used for their mining. As a financial asset, cryptocurrency can be a “financial bubble” because their value increasing often exceeds the cost of mining. On the other hand, given the emergence of cryptocurrency as a phenomenon of the information economy, the paper analyses the impact of specific technical features (cryptographic hashing algorithm, the complexity of creating new blocks, the technology of verification of mining operations, etc.) on the risk of investing in cryptocurrency assets. © 2022 University of Tehran.

In this study, based on novel corporate data, expert interviews, focus groups with members of the public, extensive site visits across Greenland, Iceland and Norway and a literature review, we look at the energy and climate impacts of existing and proposed datacenters, both quantitatively and in terms of stakeholder and public perceptions. The paper examines datacenter management and sustainability practices in the Nordic region. It explores what community impacts occur, and how communities manage conflicting objectives. It investigates the technical and policy options that can make datacenters more sustainable and/or lower-carbon and it explores associated stakeholder and public views in the three countries. In exploring these themes, our study examines the shifting energy governance of datacenters, including patterns of electricity consumption and cooling but also circular economy operations and power densities. We also analyze a series of 40 solutions for eco-friendly design or green datacenter management across the entire lifecycle. We conclude with implications for energy and climate policy as well as future research. © 2021 The Authors","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency mining; Datacenters; Greenland; Iceland; Norway; Server farms; Sustainable development goals","Bitcoin; Environmental protection; Life cycle; Public policy; Cryptocurrency mining; Datacenter; Datacenter managements; Energy impact; Green land; Icelands; Norway; Policy options; Server farms; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable development","","","","","Ethical and Sustainable Arctic Economies, Environments and Societies; JUSTNORTH; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020, (869327)","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 869327 , “Toward Just, Ethical and Sustainable Arctic Economies, Environments and Societies (JUSTNORTH).” The content of this deliverable does not reflect the official opinion of the European Union.

From early October 2020 to early January 2021, the price of a single Bitcoin token went from roughly $10,000 to nearly $65,000, reinspiring the hopes of the crypto-faithful in the inevitability of a future beyond centralized banking and leaving the rest to dread the jargon of computational libertarianism. The speculative betting driving this recent price action, however, belies a more rudimentary and overlooked shift in the digital economy signaled by cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular. Unlike an earlier industrial logic that sought to reduce heat loss and improve efficiency to maximize surplus value, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system shifts the basis of value production from efficiency to inefficiency. Moreover, it does so by using a cryptographic algorithm whose purpose is to destroy the meaning of its inputs. Through an exploration of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work technics and its inversion of traditional models of value extraction, the text argues that Bitcoin reveals a profound transformation in the nature of surplus represented by computational capitalism. © 2022 The University of Chicago.

Design/methodology/approach: The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of 138 listed financial firms from four emerging Asian countries for the period 2016–2020. Findings: This study finds that changes in VC values have greater spillover effects on the values of financial stocks in countries which do not recognize the legitimacy of VCs than in countries which do, due to the lack of breadth and depth of the former markets. Moreover, this paper also reports evidence of the greater moderating role of investor attention on this relationship in countries which do not recognize the legitimacy of VCs than in countries which do. Originality/value: Although numerous studies have been conducted on the influence of VCs on stock performance, majority of these studies did not distinguish whether the sample countries being studied actually recognize the legitimacy of VC transactions or not. Moreover, extant literature has not considered the moderating role of investor attention on this relationship. It is the aim of this study to address these research voids by using a refined three-factor theory model of capital asset pricing model incorporating VCs to better represent stock performance in the digital economy era. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asian equity markets; Bitcoin; Capital asset pricing model; Investor attention; Stock performance; Virtual currency development","","","","","","","","Ahmed W.M.A., Is there a risk-return trade-off in cryptocurrency markets?

Indeed, the economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Chinese Taipei had undergone an unprecedented level of development in an extremely short span of time following decolonialisation, causing the World Bank to dub them “The East Asian Miracle”. Yet, as the world moves into the digital age, new hurdles present themselves on the horizon for these mammoths to overcome. Of these, one of the tallest, and perhaps most unpredictable, seems to be the increasingly disruptive nature of decentralised digital assets (“DDA”). Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, the use, development and activity of DDAs has been growing at an unprecedented rate across the globe. With a global market cap of over $1 Trillion USD in crypto-assets alone, DDAs undoubtedly would play a significant role in the modern global economy. Yet, despite the huge potential around these assets, policy-makers have become particularly wary of these DDAs. The emphasis on their decentralised nature has presented them as a way for users to undermine the traditional regulatory mechanisms. Particularly here, DDAs have gained notoriety as tools for assisting in money-laundering, and bypassing state-imposed economic sanctions. Studies by the International Federation of Accountants here note 5 common ways these occurs: (1) predicating crime, (2) converting illegally obtained digital assets into tangible assets, (3) hiding transactions through anonymised services, (4) layering numerous exchanges of assets from tangible to intangible to mask transactions, and (5) the integration and legitimisation of income. In light of these concerns, regional harmonised approaches seem to be taking centre stage. In Europe, significant discussion has been placed around the recent Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. On the other side of the Atlantic, the United States seems to be working on similar provisions, following the recent leak of the draft bill regulating DeFi and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (‘DAO”). Yet, such a harmonised approach seems to be lacking in Asia. Instead, competition between the Asian Tigers to attract investors has resulted in starkly individualised approaches among them, each looking to out-position the other to take advantage of these new developments. However, this disharmonised and fragmented approach ultimately led to cracks appearing in the regulatory firewall, often through policy oversights. This paper will thus take a comparative, and law-economics based approach towards the law governing DDAs across these 4 high-income economies, particularly the laws governing transnational anti-money laundering mechanisms, and the place of DDAs in the law of sanctions among these nations. It primarily considers this from the perspectives of DDAs as a tool, and their impacts on how nation-states craft anti-money laundering laws (“AML”). While it ultimately concludes that the fragmented approach is acceptable given the current situation, greater cooperation between both private and public stakeholders is imperative towards the development of the law of sanctions. In doing a comparative analysis within these economies, this paper looks at 2 key areas within AML on digital assets. Firstly, it considers the extent of which regulatory mechanisms (such as disclosure of identities) interact with these DDAs within the local economies. Then, it considers how sanctions target DDAs, and the relevant AML laws. A further dimension that is also explored is the role of Virtual Asset Service Providers (“VASPs”) within these economies, and the nature of the set of rights which are attached to these DDAs. It then discusses how this domestic legislation would interact with the growing body of international law instruments that have been in the works, including the guidelines introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”), and the United Nations International Institute for the Unification of Private Law. It is then argued here that the crux of the interaction between the law of sanctions and domestic legislation on DDAs lies in the conversion between DDAs and tangible assets. The role of AMLs should then look to combat the conversion of “dirty” assets as a whole. Ultimately, the comparative analysis concludes with a brief discussion of mechanisms to strengthen and, to an extent, harmonise international laws in this field. Firstly, the doctrine of comity between nations should once more be reaffirmed and strengthened. This ensures mutual recognition of regulatory attempts between these economies mutually strengthening AML legislation through the Courts in a bottom-up, but also a top-down regulatory perspective. This similarly extends to provisions around regional cooperation across the private sector, and mechanisms where these economies can implement to encourage such cooperation. Secondly, a discussion is had about the use of corporate standards for future regulatory work; concerns that AML might be too reactive, or “out-of-date” is rather prominent. Hence, futureproofing through working with various stakeholders to develop comprehensive frameworks to encapsulate the relevant features and novelties with DDAs would prove invaluable. Such would then allow these economies to fully utilise DDAs to their full potential while ensuring compliance with the law of sanctions. © 2023, University of Torino.

Blockchain networks, and by extension cryptocurrencies, were created with the promise of giving that power to users. The most well-known example of a blockchain technology achieving such decentralization is Bitcoin, but its popularity has arguably been matched by an alternative-currency named Dogecoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which have marketed themselves on differentiating technical features, Dogecoin’s allure likely stems from its cultural roots as a meme. Where cryptocurrency is typically regarded as a difficult topic to grasp, the introduction of Doge’s (2013) most popular meme, into the crypto-space increased crypto’s accessibility to new participants. Consequently, Dogecoin exists in two economies: the financial economy and the cultural meme economy, with the latter having unprecedented tangible impacts on the former. Dogecoin’s unique cultural significance provides an example of how blockchain can succeed in promoting alternative money systems. At its peak in 2021, Dogecoin achieved a market capitalization of $88 billion. Where analysis of the Dogecoin phenomenon is lacking in the current literature, we will fill that gap with a case study of Dogecoin. By studying Dogecoin as a combination of money and meme, we can further our understanding of how to better promote social finance initiatives through the virality of memes. © The Author(s) 2022.","Alt-currency; bets; bitcoin; blockchain; cryptocurrency; digital currency; digital meme; doge; Dogecoin; meme; meme economy; meme finance; meme value; r/wallstreetbets; wall street social finance","","","","","","","","Bambara J.J., Allen P.R., Blockchain: A Practical Guide to Developing Business, Law, and Technology Solutions, (2018); Bambrough B., As the bitcoin price soars, bitcoin’s ‘real’ crypto market dominance is revealed, Forbes, (2020); Batiz-Lazo B., Haigh T., Stearns D.L., How the future shaped the past: the case of the cashless society, Enterprise and Society, 15, 1, pp. 103-131, (2014); Bjurg O., How is Bitcoin Money?, Theory, Culture & Society, 33, 1, pp. 53-72, (2016); Bohme R., Christin N., Edelman B., Et al., Bitcoin: economics, technology, and governance, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29, 2, pp. 213-238, (2015); Brown A., Founder of wallstreetbets discusses why the group unleashed chaos on gamestop—and why he’s (really) exiled from reddit, Forbes, (2021); Bury B., Creative use of internet memes in advertising, World Scientific News, 57, 1, pp. 33-41, (2016); Calcaterra C., Kaal W.A., Rao V., Stable cryptocurrencies, Washington UniversityJournal of Law & Policy, 61, 1, pp. 193-228, (2020); Chayka K., Wow this is dog, The Verge, (2013); Chohan U.W., A History of Dogecoin, (2017); Dawkins R., The Selfish Gene, (1976); Dodd N., The social life of bitcoin, Theory, Culture & Society, 35, 5, pp. 35-56, (2018); Dodd N., The Social Life of Money, (2016); Diaz M., Dogecoin lacks direction; trades bearishly at $0.0034, NameCoin News, (2020); Esteves V., Meikle G., ‘LOOK @ THIS FUKKEN DOGE’: internet memes and remix cultures, The Routledge Companion to Alternative and Community Media, pp. 561-570, (2015); Friedman Z., Dogecoin Explodes To $2 Billion, Reaches All-Time High, Forbes, (2018); Gal N., Shifman L., Kampf Z., It gets better"": Internet memes and the construction of collective identity, New Media & Society, 18, 8, pp. 1698-1714, (2016); Gandal N., Halaburda H., Can we predict the winner in a market with network effects? competition in cryptocurrency market, Games, 7, 3, (2016); Greenfield A., Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life, (2017); Gurdus L., Bitcoin could be on track to $74,000, trader says as cryptocurrency approaches all-time highs., CNBC, (2020); Hackett R., What is Dogecoin?, Fortune, (2020); Herrigan M., Shi L., Illum J., Airdrops and privacy: a case study in cross-blockchain analysis, pp. 63-70, (2018); Huang D.Y., Levchenko K., Snoeren A.C., Estimating Profitability of Alternative Crypto- Currencies, (2018); Ingham G., Money is a social relation, Review of Social Economy, 54, 4, pp. 507-529, (1996); Jeong S., Dogecoin, Paid_ Tales of Dongles, Checks, and Other Money Stuff, pp. 53-70, (2017); Judmayer A., Zamyatin A., Stifter N., Merged mining: Curse or cure?

The purpose of the study is twofold. First, the study investigates the presence of the pure (narrow) form of financial contagion between cryptocurrency and stock markets in both advanced and emerging economies, during the black swan event of the COVID-19 crisis. Second, the study examines the hedging and safe-haven properties of cryptocurrencies against equity markets, before and during periods of financial upheaval triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two econometric models are used: (1) the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH and (2) the wavelet analysis models. Using the DCC GARCH model, the study found the evidence of high conditional correlations between cryptocurrency and equity markets. The high conditional correlation was mostly detected in periods of financial turmoil corresponding to the first quarter and the second quarter of 2020. The increase in conditional correlation during periods of financial upheaval (compared to a tranquil period) indicates the presence of the pure form of financial contagion. The wavelet cross-correlation analysis showed the evidence of positive cross-correlation between the Bitcoin and the equity markets during period of financial turmoil. The cross-correlation was identified in both short and long (coarse) scales. In short scales, the equity markets lead the cryptocurrency market, while the cryptocurrency market leads equity markets in coarse scales. The findings of the present study revealed that the degree of interdependence between cryptocurrency and equity markets has substantially increased during the COVID-19 period, and this has negated the safe-haven and hedging benefits of cryptocurrencies over equity markets. © 2023 The Author(s).

While various empirical studies have explored risk transmission among financial markets, this study examined the shock spillover network across green markets, including the energy, solar, wind, water, and environment markets, as well as Bitcoins, uncertainty, and the US stock market. Indeed, this paper is the first study to ascertain whether green commodities, Bitcoins, and uncertainty are connected to the US stock market. Using the quantile vector autoregressive (VAR) connectedness framework, the key findings are as follows: (i) A static spillover network showed there was high spillover transfer between markets at extreme market states. (ii) Global green economy and global clean energy markets act as the highest contributors of information spillover under bearish market scenarios. (iii) With regard to dynamic connectedness, this work highlights the asymmetric spillover effect of green commodities, Bitcoins, and uncertainty on the US stock market. (iv) Bitcoin (BTC), uncertainty, and global carbon indexes were found to be net receipts of shock spillovers, while most green commodities acted as net contributors. (v) Significant implications for environmental and financial investors as well as policymakers are provided. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; Green commodity; Network analysis; Spillover connectedness; Uncertainty","Carbon; Investments; United States; carbon; commodity; environmental economics; green economy; health policy; spillover effect; stock market; Article; carbon footprint; cryptocurrency; economic aspect; empirical research; environmental economics; hydropower; performance indicator; renewable energy; risk management; sensitivity analysis; social network analysis; solar energy; stock market; uncertainty; water management; wind power; investment","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ","","","","","Ahmad W., On the dynamic dependence and investment performance of crude oil and clean energy stocks, Res.

In contrast to hard cash, digital currency does not have a physical form. It exists in electronic forms only. To date, it has not been clear what impacts its ongoing growth will have, if any, on wealth distribution. Here, we propose to identify all forms of contemporary wealth into two classes: ‘distinguishable’ or ‘identical’. Traditional tangible moneys are all distinguishable. Financial assets and cryptocurrencies, such as bank deposits and Bitcoin, are boson-like, while non-fungible tokens are fermion-like. We derived their ownership-based distributions in a unified manner. Each class follows essentially the Poisson or the geometric distribution. We contrast their distinct features such as Gini coefficients. Furthermore, aggregating different kinds of wealth corresponds to a weighted convolution where the number of banks matters and Bitcoin follows Bose–Einstein distribution. Our proposal opens a new avenue to understand the deepened inequality in modern economy, which is based on the statistical physics property of wealth rather than the individual ability of owners. We call for verifications with real data.

This article focuses on analysing the emergence, functionality, and future role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. By interpreting the theoretical aspects of money, the emergence of cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology, the authors tried to determine whether cryptocurrencies have the potential to become the money of the future. In the article, the analysis of cryptocurrencies functioning in the modern world focuses on the role of technological development and innovations in their use and popularity. SWOT and speculative analyses of cryptocurrencies, which have been touted as the money of the future, were also carried out. The results obtained from the research show that cryptocurrencies have many advantages over traditional payment methods. Elimination of intermediaries, low transaction costs, safe storage of data, limited increase in monetary supply, globalization, and privacy are stated as the most important of these opportunities. In addition, energy use, inaccessibility without the internet, high volatility, and cyber-Attacks were seen as the most important threats and weaknesses. When developments in the world follow, it can be seen that there are many blockchain-based opportunities or threats. Despite this, blockchain technology offers great opportunities. As a result, countries and individuals should turn to this technology now to benefit more in the future.

The portfolios of investors who made decisions in uncertain conditions have been affected by these fluctuations that have caused volatility in the stock market's indexes. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the Fear Index (FI), the Dollar Index, and Bitcoin on the volatility of the Borsa Istanbul 100 Index (BIST). Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) time series analysis was used for the study, which revealed that the Dollar Index has no effect on volatility, while the FI was found to have an effect on volatility both in the short and long runs. In addition, Bitcoin was determined to have an effect on volatility only in the long run. When the period of the data used is examined, the outbreak of the Russia–Ukraine war in February 2022 is thought to be the reason for the increase in the FI. It can be assumed that the decisions of investors to invest in the BIST were adversely affected by the war as a natural consequence of this, and investors who ceased investing in the BIST index opted to invest elsewhere. © 2023 AESS Publications.

So, the present study attempts to investigate the static and dynamic connexions between liquid and futures markets of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple XRP and Bitcoin Cash from June 2018 to June 2022. The connexion between their liquid and futures markets is first investigated using unconditional correlation, Johansen’s cointegration, vector error correction and Wald’s block exogeneity. Their estimates discern connexions encompassing significant long-run relationships between their liquid and futures markets; momentous unidirectional long-run causality from their futures market to liquid market; and momentous bidirectional short-run causality from their liquid market to futures market and from their futures market to liquid market. The present treatise encompasses methodological advancement in the investigation of interconnectedness between these markets by employing a dynamic conditional correlation model and a wavelet transform framework. Their discerned estimates indicate that the markets of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash have only momentous long-run perseverance, lingering and spillover effects of shocks’ sway on conditional correlations. However, there is momentous short- and long-run perseverance, lingering and spillover effects in the case of Ripple XRP. The wavelet coherence analysis also confirms these results by indicating a bidirectional short-run causal relation and a long-run positive comovement between liquid returns and futures returns of these cryptocurrencies. These discernments may help investors, portfolio managers and policymakers to enhance hedging effectiveness through optimal portfolio allocation and monitor financial contagion to attain and sustain financial stability in economies. © 2023 MDI.","Causality;

However, existing solutions have two major limitations: First, since the watchtower's inaction or collusion with counterparties, the deposits in off-chain transactions will be threatened; Second, due to occasional false positives, the efficiency of the single watchtower in monitoring the payment channels for fraud is questionable. To solve this, we present anti-collusion multiparty smart contracts for distributed watchtowers in PCNs. Specifically, we first design the distributed watchtower mechanism to solve the false positive problem in regulating PCNs. In addition, we utilize smart contracts to constrain and force counterparties to relinquish collusion in the distributed watchtower mechanism, thus making collusion impossible for rational parties. We further offer a mathematical proof and contract implementation in Solidity. Finally, extensive experiments and contracts executed on Ethereum under various benchmarks with baseline comparison demonstrate the validity of our proposals. Specifically, our scheme can both improve the throughput and accuracy by up to 20-25% and 10-15%, respectively, and reduce the false positive rate by up to 10% compared with existing single watchtower mechanism.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","collusion attacks; crypto-economy; ethereum; payment channel networks; smart contract; Watchtowers","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Crime; Ethereum; Game theory; Monitoring; Network protocols; Network security; Anti collusions; Channel network; Collusion attack; Crypto-economy; Fraud; Game; Payment channel network; Routings; Security; Watchtower; Smart contract","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Ethereum Wiki: Geth, (2015); Khan N., State R., Lightning network: A comparative review of transaction fees and data analysis, Blockchain and Applications (Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing), (2019); Back A., Et al., Enabling Blockchain Innovations With Pegged Sidechains [EB/OL], (2014); Zhang Y., Yang D., Xue G., Yu R., Counter-collusion smart contracts for watchtowers in payment channel networks, Proc.

Methodology: the text constitutes a qualitative analysis of doctrine and legislation, with results obtained by the inductive method. Results: the anonymity provided by the systems used by cryptocurrencies can encourage the practice of crimes such as money laundering, tax evasion, drug trade, illegal sale of arms and others, which has led some countries to issue regulations on the use of cryptocurrencies. The problem with regulation lies in the fact that it is technically very complex to identify both ownership and operations carried out through this type of asset, and there are even those who claim that such a possibility does not exist, at least with the means and technology currently available. Contributions: in addition to the historical-evolutionary approach of the central theme, the text addresses issues such as the concept of currency; the economic relations in the informational era, with the increasing transactions of virtual currencies in electronic networks; the legal security; monitoring and regulation by a monetary authority to curb the financing of illegal activities, money laundering or possible financial instability in the economy and the technical limits that challenge the effectiveness of this type of regulation.

Its development has led to the emergence of a huge number of additional institutions, financial instruments, and new forms of interaction between people in our society. The article aims to deepen the theoretical and practical provisions of the characterization and development of cryptocurrency as a phenomenon of the modern world economy. The study applied the method of cognition of phenomena and processes, which allows us to consider them in development and interrelation, as well as to identify established patterns and trends. In the course of proving the key theoretical positions, deductive and inductive methods have been applied. Dialectical and systemic-structural approaches were used to clarify certain provisions. At the theoretical level, in addition to the above, we used such methods as conceptual (terminological), formalization, and axiomatic, since some theoretical statements were accepted without evidence. The synthetic method was used to summarize various subjective ideas and theories of researchers in the field of economics. The analytical method was used to analyze scientific sources on economics in the economic research space. The practical significance of the research results lies in the possibility of their use for further development of theoretical and practical approaches to forecasting the impact of cryptocurrency on the global economy in the future.

Although the previous empirical evidence points towards strong connections among selected cryptocurrencies or, from the other side, weak dependence between Bitcoin and traditional financial assets, a focused study on the dynamics of return and volatility connectedness among a wider range of cryptocurrencies is lacking, and more so, one directed towards the very first actual critical period of the global economy coinciding with relevant crypto-markets. Using data for the 10 most capitalized cryptocurrencies between 1st October 2017 and 5th January 2021, we examine how cryptocurrencies interact and whether they have a clear leader, with a special focus on differences with respect to investment horizons and how the relationship structure evolves in time. We uncover a structural change in the connectedness evolving in 2020 as the market restructures in reaction to the unprecedented monetary injections as a counter to the COVID-19-induced economic standstill. The structural change is shown not only for cryptocurrencies considered separately but also when we jointly examine them with traditional assets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; COVID-19 outbreak; Cryptocurrencies; Returns and volatility spillovers; Time and frequency connectedness","","","","","","Academic Financial Aid Project for Top Talents in Universities of Anhui, (gxbjZD14)","Dr. Najaf Iqbal gratefully acknowledges the support from Academic Financial Aid Project for Top Talents in Universities of Anhui via grant number gxbjZD14 .

The other sees this same technology as merely a novel mechanism for enabling more crime, corruption, and money laundering. Both positions contain an element of truth, but both share a common misapprehension: They assume that digital assets are beyond the reach of law enforcement and regulatory agencies–which is decidedly not the case, at least for now. But the digital asset economy evolves rapidly. To stay ahead of the curve, authorities will need to adapt existing rules and regulations about money-laundering, sanctions, and sending funds to rogue states–tools originally designed for an entirely different financial infrastructure–to mitigate threats to the financial system posed by virtual assets. © 2022 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.","Bitcoin; blockchain; central bank digital currencies; digital assets; financial asset; North Korea; regulation","","","","","","Royal United Services Institute","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Compared with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), Edwards curves digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) has the advantages of faster calculation speed, smaller key and signature space, and is widely used in the signature of Libra transactions. However, as a deterministic signature algorithm, it is vulnerable to differential fault attacks resulting in key loss and leakage. It is a challenge that how to resist this kind of attack and design a provably secure EdDSA signature. Therefore, we firstly define the security properties are firstly defined that the digital signature scheme against differential fault attacks that must be meet, and differential fault attack technology is utilized to cryptanalyze the EdDSA signature algorithm, and an EdDSA signature scheme that resists differential fault attacks is proposed, and it is proved that the scheme satisfies the existence of unforgeable under adaptive selection message attack (EUF-CMA) and resistance to differential fault attack. In order to reduce the risk of signature private key leakage, with the help of Paillier homomorphic encryption technology, we design a two-party cooperative EdDSA signature scheme against differential fault attack is designed, and prove the security of the scheme based on the universally composable (UC) security model is proved. Finally, we implement the two-party cooperative ECDSA signature algorithm and the two-party cooperative EdDSA signature algorithm against differential fault attack are implemented, and the implementation demonstrates that the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Design/methodology/approach: A unique dataset from a person-to-person (p2p) exchange is used to investigate association between Bitcoin trading volume and currency prices. Currency returns are used to identify local economic crises, the 8 crisis affected currencies are Venezuela Bolivar (VES), Iranian Rial (IRR), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Argentine Peso (ARS), Egyptian Pound (EGP), Nigerian Naira (NGN), Turkish Lira (TRY) and Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT). Findings: The paper demonstrates that local economic crises are positively associated with increased Bitcoin trading. There is a negative association between trading volume and currency value (and return), suggesting low currency price and currency depreciation are accompanied with increased Bitcoin trading. The results not only hold for the crisis affected currencies but also currencies of advanced economies. Granger causality test also reinforces the negative association results. Originality/value: The finding indicates some forms of flight-to-safety have occurred during local market crises when capital flight from domestic markets to Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin’s hedging asset status. However, total global trading volume declines after the start of the COVID pandemic, suggesting that Bitcoin is still regarded as a speculative asset. Overall, the findings show that Bitcoin is a hedging asset to protect against local currency depreciation, but not a safe-haven asset for the global crisis. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Currency devaluation; Economic crisis","","","","","","","","Balcilar M., Bouri E., Gupta R., Roubaud D., Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility?

The study used time series quarterly data on bitcoin, financial stability, inflation rate, real GDP, economic volatility uncertainty, exchange rate, and market volatility index for the period 2015Q1–2022Q4. The robustness of the findings was confirmed by the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and canonical cointegration regression (CCR). The study results demonstrated that an increase in cryptocurrency investments will affect the financial stability of India significantly. Each 1% increase in the cryptocurrency would reduce the financial stability by 5% approximately. However, there was a marginal effect of cryptocurrency on economic growth. The results also found that exchange rate volatility and inflationary pressure would also deteriorate the financial stability of the country. Furthermore, the results also identified positive and significant cointegration between economic growth and financial stability. Due to most transactions in the economy being done through the financial system, it is paramount for economic growth. Going forward, aggressive monetary policy tightening, volatility in capital flows and exchange rates, de-anchoring of inflation expectations, faltering in the economic recovery, disruptions due to global supply chains and climate change will be the major risks to the financial stability and economic growth of India. © Shrikant Panigrahi, 2023.","bitcoin; cointegration; cryptocurrencies; financial stability; GDP growth; India","","","","","","","","Abbasi K.

For some, these cryptocurrencies constitute rebellion against the existing system as governments encourage uncontrolled expansions in the money supply; for some others, it is a quick source of income. Undeniably, the volume of the crypto money market has grown considerably in recent years, regardless of the reasoning of the people who invest and trade in this field. At this point, one of the most important questions to be investigated is “what variables have caused the tremendous growth in the crypto money quantities in recent years?” This study tests the assumption that changes in cryptocurrencies are affected by changes in national currencies. Thus, the Bitcoin price is the dependent variable, and M1 monetary supply changes in the USA, European Union and Japanese economies are considered independent variables. The variables in this study were tested using the time-varying Granger causality method. The results obtained from this study confirm the philosophy of Bitcoin's emergence and the possibility that it can be a hedge against the inflationary effects of money, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","bayesian-var; central banks policies; monetary systems; money supply; subsample Wald tests; time-varying Granger causality","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D, Johnson S, Querubin P, When does policy reform work?

It highlights two objectives: how the technology can be used as an alternative financing tool and how it can improve efficiency and transparency in the financial management of tourism companies. This study shows that initial coin offerings are an effective way to finance innovative tourism projects and that blockchain technology can improve the competitiveness and efficiency of tourism companies. Due to the lack of empirical data on the actual implementation and impact of blockchain technology in the tourism industry, it is suggested that further research is needed to examine the practical application of blockchain technology in the tourism industry, its potential impact on tourism businesses and its implications for the regulatory framework. The proposed methodology includes a systematic literature review on the application of blockchain technology for the financing of tourism projects and the financial improvement of tourism business models. The results indicate that blockchain technology has the potential to transform the financing and financial management of the tourism industry and improve its efficiency and transparency. Furthermore, combining blockchain with other technologies can provide additional benefits in supply chain management and event automation. © 2023 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; Bitcoin; blockchain; cost efficiency; cryptocurrency; financing","business; competitiveness; financial system; literature review; management practice; supply chain management; tourism economics","","","","","","","Swan M., Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy, (2015); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Prados-Castillo J.F., Porras Gonzalez E., Martin Martin J.M., Blockchain Applications in the Digitalization Processes of the Tourism Sector, Digitalization in Business: On the Road to a Sustainable World, (2022); Porras E., Sanchez G., Decentralized Blockchain for Autobiographical Memory in Cognitive Robotics, J.

The stabilization property of this kind of currency derives from the mechanism by which changes in commodity prices motivate the holders of the stock of currency to shift their demand for it such that its acquisition cost equates to its purchasing power in terms of goods and services. When a country is large relative to the international market for specie, maintenance of price stability may require adjustments in the seigniorage charge, whereas in countries with closed economies such adjustments are in general imperative. In addition, through seigniorage adjustments, the price level may even be held fixed irrespective of the magnitude and origin of shocks, the relative size of the country, and the degree of its openness, whereas at the zero bound of the seigniorage charge, the same result may be achieved though lowering the specie content of the currency. These results are consistent with the monetary experiences of Athens in classical times, France during the period AD 1350–1436, Spain in the sixteenth century, the United States in AD 1870–1914, and China in AD 1910–35.

Our mixed-methods study of the cryptocurrency industry draws on fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) to analyze archival and interview data and offer new theory on how decentralized platforms coordinate activities to grow in an early-stage, before network effects kick in. We find that, in the absence of a central authority, platforms coordinate activities with three mechanisms, namely decentralized (a) algorithmic coordination, (b) social coordination, and (c) goal coordination. Our QCA treat these mechanisms as explanatory conditions and, using a representative sample of 20 cryptocurrency platforms, reveal which configurations of decentralized coordination mechanisms nurture, or hinder, early-stage platform growth. Managerial Summary: Firms operate around a managerial hierarchy that distributes tasks, resources, information, and rewards to organizational members who pursue common goals as contract-bound employees. From 2009, a new organizational form, called the “decentralized platform,” emerged and diffused without relying on hierarchy nor managerial authority—and without having to employ anyone. The most prominent decentralized platform, Bitcoin, has millions of users, thousands of contributors, and a market valuation never achieved before by an organization without a CEO nor shareholders. This study explicates how this unprecedented level of organizational decentralization functions in practice. We foreshadow implications for the digital economy, wherein “Web3” innovations, such as non-fungible tokens and DAOs, have already shifted the orchestrating role played by platforms in capitalist societies. © 2022 The Authors.

The means evolved from barter to things or commodities to metal and paper as the base materials for money before arriving at barter. With such significant changes, there is also a need for a transformation in the world of education in order to welcome technological advancements and one way to survive the changes in the increasingly rapid digital era. As the economic need increases, trade transaction methods shift from traditional to internet-based. One of the necessary international online payment options is bitcoin. For many applications where payments are modest and instantaneous approval is required, Bitcoin is inappropriate because of the high transaction fees and long confirmation periods. As a result, despite the introduction of numerous rival cryptocurrencies to address these problems, the Bitcoin network continues to be the most extensively used payment method. Unquestionably, new finding of this research that effectively address the problems of high transaction costs and transaction verification times are needed if the company is to benefit from its user network. The Lightning Network (LN), which makes use of off-chain bidirectional payment channels between participants, is one of the most recent payment network concepts to be proposed. © Henderi1, Qurotul Aini, Danny Manongga, Irwan Sembiring, Dwi Apriliasari.","Bitcoin; Education; Payment","","","","","","","","Watini S., Aini Q., Rahardja U., Santoso N.

This technology relies on a backbone of distributed data architecture and peer-to-peer networking model called Blockchain. Unlike the current digital economy, which is governed centrally by financial institution or governments, Blockchain is fully autonomous without any third-party involvement. The exorbitant success of Bitcoin has attracted investors, scholars as well as organizations to peek into this lucrative technology for the possible application to other areas apart from crypto-currency. Blockchain can adopt Smart Contracts, which are digitally enabled contracts that can be executed and enforced fully or partially using pre-defined notions. The aim of this research is to investigate the synergy between Smart Contract and Blockchain to propose a digital framework for an academic paper publication model that has the capability to automate the entire process and challenge the existing system. It can also bring together all the stakeholders under the same system. The proposed model can further hold the stakeholders accountable for breach of contracts and/or reward them for executing the successes of terms pre-configured in the Smart Contract. The proposed model, called Digital Smart Publication or DSP (as referred in the document), is highly secure and ensures balance in distributing rewards to the involved stakeholders while keeping data integrity and security as paramount features. © 2019, Amol Thakre, Fadi Thabtah, Seyed Reza Shahamiri and Suhel Hammoud.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Ethereum; Information technology; Research publication; Smart Contract","","","","","","","","Narayanan A., Joseph B., Edward Felten A.M., Goldfeder S., Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies, (2016); Azer S.A., Dupras D.M., Azer S.A., Writing for publication in medical education in high impact journals, Eur.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that attracts much attention but remains difficult to understand. Particularly important to the success, stability, and security of Bitcoin is a component of the system called mining. Miners are responsible for validating transactions and are incentivized to participate by the promise of a monetary reward. Mining pools have emerged as collectives of miners that ensure a more stable and predictable income. MiningVis aims to help analysts understand the evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including mining market statistics, multi-measure mining pool rankings, and pool hopping behavior. Each of these features can be compared to external data concerning pool characteristics and Bitcoin news. In order to assess the value of MiningVis, we conducted online interviews and insight-based user studies with Bitcoin miners. We describe research questions tackled and insights made by our participants and illustrate practical implications for visual analytics systems for Bitcoin mining.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Bitcoin mining;

This seems quite surprising, given the otherwise extensive research on money and finance in the international political economy (IPE) literature. This essay calls for a greater engagement of IPE scholarship in analyzing cryptocurrencies as money. It argues first that theories of money—in particular, the “commodity theory of money” and the “state theory of money”—could provide valuable theoretical insights for the IPE study of cryptocurrencies as money. It then suggests how these insights can be incorporated into that research, drawing particular attention to analysis of the political dynamics surrounding cryptocurrencies’ development as money. © 2022 The Author(s).

Predicting the future value of bitcoin can help investors to make more educated decisions and to provide authorities with a point of reference for evaluating cryptocurrency. The novelty of the proposed prediction models lies in the use of artificial intelligence to identify movement cryptocurrency prices, particularly bitcoin prices. A forecasting model that can accurately and reliably predict the market’s volatility and price variations is necessary for portfolio management and optimization in this continually expanding financial market. In this paper, we investigate a time series analysis that makes use of deep learning to investigate volatility and provide an explanation for this behavior. Our findings have managerial ramifications, such as the potential for developing a product for investors. This can help to expand upon our model by adjusting various hyperparameters to produce a more accurate model for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies. Another possible managerial implication of our findings is the potential for developing a product for investors, as it can predict the price of cryptocurrencies more accurately. The proposed models were evaluated by collecting historical bitcoin prices from 1 January 2021 to 16 June 2022. The results analysis of the GRU and MLP models revealed that the MLP model achieved highly efficient regression, at R = 99.15% during the training phase and R = 98.90% during the testing phase. These findings have the potential to significantly influence the appropriateness of asset pricing, considering the uncertainties caused by digital currencies. In addition, these findings provide instruments that contribute to establishing stability in cryptocurrency markets. By assisting asset assessments of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, our models deliver high and steady success outcomes over a future prediction horizon. In general, the models described in this article offer approximately accurate estimations of the real value of the bitcoin market. Because the models enable users to assess the timing of bitcoin sales and purchases more accurately, they have the potential to influence the economy significantly when put to use by investors and traders. © 2022 by the authors.","bitcoin; cryptocurrency markets; deep learning; prediction models; statistical analysis","","","","","","Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; King Faisal University, KFU, (145)","This work was supported by the Saudi Investment Bank Chair for Investment Awareness Studies, the Deanship of Scientific Research, the vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia (Grant No. 145).

Most previous studies had focused more on the transaction layer, but less on the network layer. In this paper, we developed BNS(Bitcoin Network Sniffer), which could find and connect nodes in the Bitcoin network, and made a measurement in detail. We collected nearly 4.1 million nodes in 1.5 hours and identified 9,515 reachable nodes. We counted the reachable nodes' properties such as: service type, port number, client version and geographic distribution. In addition, we analyzed the stability of the reachable nodes in depth and found nearly 60% kept stable during 15 days. Finally, we proposed a new approach to infer the Bitcoin network topology by analyzing the Neighbor Addresses of Adjacent Nodes and their timestamps, which had an accuracy over 80%.  © 2013 China Institute of Communications.","Bitcoin network; network topology; node properties; node stability; reachable nodes","","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, (2009); Liang W., Pustogarov I., Towards Better Understanding of Bitcoin Unreachable Peers, (2017); Donet J., Perez-Sola C., Et al., The bitcoin p2p network, Proc.

Since this is highly unlikely, optimizing risk and return is a practical solution. Bitcoin is a new financial product that can be included in an investment portfolio. This paper looks at Bitcoins as a separate asset class and attempts to capture the volatility using the Exponential GARCH (E-GARCH) as well as to check if Bitcoins can be used as an optimal tool to hedge using the Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH against four traditional asset classes in the U.S. economy which includes the stock market (S&P 500 index), Bonds (U.S. Aggregate Bond Index), Gold and Crude Oil. The period of study is a little over 7 years. The results suggest that Bitcoin stands as a highly speculative class of asset with extremely high volatility and with respect to hedging, Bitcoin stands as a possible tool of hedge with the U.S. Aggregate Bond index and to a certain extent against Gold but fails to be an optimal hedge against the S&P 500 and Crude Oil in the U.S. economy between April 29, 2013 and October 31, 2019 due to its highly volatile nature. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Ahmad W., Sadorsky P., Sharma A., Optimal hedge ratios for clean energy equities, Economic Modelling, 72, pp. 278-295, (2018); Basher S.A., Sadorsky P., Hedging emerging market stock prices with oil, gold, VIX, and bonds: A comparison between DCC, ADCC and GO-GARCH, Energy Economics, 54, pp. 235-247, (2016); Baur D.G., Dimpfl T., Kuck K., Bitcoin, gold and the US dollar–A replication and extension, Finance Research Letters, 25, pp. 103-110, (2018); Bhatia V., Das S., Mitra S., Crude oil hedging with precious metals: A DCC-GARCH approach, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, 22, 1, pp. 1-8, (2018); (2017); Bouri E., Jalkh N., Molnar P., Roubaud D., Bitcoin for energy commodities before and after the December 2013 crash: Diversifier, hedge or safe haven?, Applied Economics, 49, 50, pp. 5063-5073, (2017); Bouri E., Molnar P., Azzi G., Roubaud D., Hagfors L.I., On the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?, Finance Research Letters, 20, pp. 192-198, (2017); Briere M., Oosterlinck K., Szafarz A., Virtual currency, tangible return: Portfolio diversification with bitcoin, Journal of Asset Management, 16, 6, pp. 365-373, (2015); Ciaian P., Rajcaniova M., Kancs D., The economics of Bitcoin price formation, Applied Economics, 48, 19, pp. 1799-1815, (2015); Dyhrberg A.H., Bitcoin, gold and the dollar – A GARCH volatility analysis, Finance Research Letters, 16, pp. 85-92, (2016); Engle R., Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 20, 3, pp. 339-350, (2002); Greer R.J., What is an asset class, anyway?, The Journal of Portfolio Management, 23, 2, pp. 86-91, (1997); Henriques I., Sadorsky P., Can Bitcoin replace gold in an investment portfolio?, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 11, 3, pp. 1-19, (2018); Katsiampa P., Volatility co-movement between Bitcoin and ether, Finance Research Letters, 30, pp. 221-227, (2019); Muglia C., Santabarbara L., Grassi S., Is Bitcoin a relevant predictor of Standard & Poor's 500?, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 12, 2, pp. 1-10, (2019); Naimy V.Y., Hayek M.R., Modelling and predicting the Bitcoin volatility using GARCH models, International Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Optimisation, 8, 3, pp. 197-215, (2018); Nakamoto S., Retrieved from, (2009); Nelson D.B., Conditional Heteroskedasticity in asset returns: A new approach, Econometrica, 59, 2, pp. 347-370, (1991); Ram A., Bitcoin as a new asset class, Meditari Accountancy Research, 27, 1, pp. 147-168, (2019); Reboredo J.C., Is gold a safe haven or a hedge for the US dollar?

Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; Chebyshev function; Cryptocurrency prediction; Functional link neural network; Genetic algorithm; Legendre polynomial; Trigonometric basis function","Bitcoin; Costs; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent computing; Investments; Motion estimation; Polynomials; Structural optimization; Accurate prediction; Comparative studies; Computational intelligence methods; Evaluation metrics; Functional expansion; Functional link neural network; Output nonlinearities; Polynomial functions; Neural networks","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Grinberg R., Bitcoin: an innovative alternative digital currency, Hast Sci Technol Law J, 4, pp. 160-207, (2011); Mai F., Et al., How does social media impact bitcoin value? a test of the silent majority hypothesis, J Manage Inf Syst, 35, 1, pp. 19-52, (2018); Sapuric S., Kokkinaki A., Bitcoin is volatile!

One of the significant risks of their spread is the increase in energy consumption, which has a negative impact on the environment due to carbon emissions. This requires the development of a scientific toolkit for assessing relationships and predicting the impact of cryptocurrencies on energy consumption, which is the aim of this paper. With the correlational regression analysis, the model of the dependence of spending on IT sector, energy consumption of Bitcoin, Ethereum and global capitalization of the cryptocurrency market was conducted, based on statistical data from Statista.com, Сoinmarketcap.com and International Data Corporation. To check the possible relationship, tests for the adequacy of the results obtained (Fisher’s test, Student’s t-test) confirmed the correctness of coefficients for independent variables. The results showed a significant direct correlation (Multiple R is 95%) of spending on IT sector, energy consumption and global capitalization of the cryptocurrency market. The established relationships allowed predicting that Bitcoin energy consumption may reach 142 Terawatt hours per year in 2026. And its impact on environment by mining in 2022 was at least 27.4 Mt of CO2 emission. As a proposal, a conclusion was made on the expediency of linking mining to the use of certain sources of electricity production, such as “residual” natural gas, nuclear power, renewable energy sources. The obtained results and conclusions may be used as a basis for political decisions in the field of energy efficiency and climate change mitigation. © The author(s) 2023.","Bitcoin; cryptocurrencies; energy consumption; energy resources; green economy; IT","","","","","","","","Andrae A., New perspectives on internet electricity use in 2030, Engineering and Applied Science Letter, 3, 2, pp. 19-31, (2020); Attarzadeh A., Balcilar M., On the dynamic return and volatility connectedness of cryptocurrency, crude oil, clean energy, and stock markets: a time-varying analysis, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 43, pp. 65185-65196, (2022); Badea L., Mungiu-Pupӑzan M.

Money has started to be perceived as a consumable service with multiple providers from which to choose. In such an environment, the question of how people consume money—instead of how they consume with money—grows in importance. This article is based on ethnographic research of Bitcoin communities in Prague and Bratislava. It examines how users variously consume Bitcoin and what consequences these diverse ways of consumption can have for the Bitcoin economy. The article identifies two discrete spheres of consumption that closely correlate with “transactional orders” or spheres of exchange as described in classical works of economic anthropology, for example, by Parry and Bloch. One of the spheres is concerned with the reproduction of social order, while the other considers the personal gain of individual consumers. The article also examines the tension between these two spheres and how it is dialectically resolved through strategies of conversion. In the final discussion, the case of Bitcoin is compared with other anthropological accounts of spheres of exchange, with special attention oriented to their dissimilarities. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association.","Bitcoin; Consumption; Conversions; Economic Spheres; Money; Transactional Orders","","","","","","Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK, (GA UK 1298119); Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK","The research was supported by Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology and by Charles University, project GA UK 1298119.

The advent of e-commerce has led to increased online transactions facilitated by e-payment systems, which can fall prey to opportunistic hackers. Cryptocurrencies have been pegged as a solution to this security issue. However, little is currently known around consumer propensity to use a cryptocurrency as an e-payment option, particularly within a developing economy. The investigated factors that could influence user adoption were based on literature and tested on a South African representative sample of 814 respondents. Of the factors identified from literature, the study found that “perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use,” “self-efficacy,” “awareness,” “trust,” and “security” have the most significant influence on South African consumers adopting a cryptocurrency as an e-payment system. © 2023 IGI Global.

We show that both the production of and the speculation with Bitcoin draw from the existing global pool of value-added. By extending the Classical Political Economy approach and the New Interpretation of the labour theory of value to the domain of digital commodities, the paper argues that Bitcoin mining is an automated reproduction process that requires no direct (living) labour and thus creates no new value. Bitcoin, in this regard, is not ‘digital gold’. Between sectors, Bitcoin mining redistributes wealth and value-added already in existence, while Bitcoin miners with more computational power compete to appropriate the mining profits within the blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain then creates rivalry in both the ownership and the use of the digital commodity through non-legal means. Our approach can be further expanded to the larger domain of automated digital commodities that are reproducible without the expenditure of direct, living labour. © 2022 The Author(s).

Whether as a revolution in payment methods, because it is a speculative asset or because of the particularities of the technology on which it is supported, cryptocurrencies are generating a greater impact on our lives, especially in the world of finance. The main objective that we set ourselves is to delve into the knowledge of cryptocurrencies and the technology that supports them, in a way that allows us to have a clear idea of the consequences that their appearance has not only in the financial field, but also in the economy in general. If we make an approximation to these cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we will be able to be aware of the advantages of their use, as well as the disadvantages of their existence, which will allow us to be aware of the role that this technology can play in the present, in the short term and long term, especially in the business field. After this analysis of the origins of Bitcoin and its evolution, we study its correlation with several assets and indices: Ethereum (second cryptocurrency with the highest value), gold (commodity considered as a refuge value), S&P500 (the most representative index of the US market) and the MSCI World Index (most representative global index), briefly explaining each of these assets, to finally analyze their correlation with Bitcoin from the year for which we have data for each one. © 2022, Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa.

One of the conclusions implies that tourists in a tourism destination still prefer paying with cash rather than paying with card or virtual currency. Moreover, the study discovered that tourists count more on virtual currency and prepare for a future with virtual currency when a factor that has an unstable impact on social economy, such as COVID-19, happens. As to the functions of Bitcoin, tourists appeared to place a great importance on its storage, value, satisfaction, convenience, and investment. Additionally, the study showed that tourists intend to continue using Bitcoin due to the same satisfaction, convenience, and investment attributed to Bitcoin. More discussion and implications were provided. © 2021 by the authors.

The vast majority of miners today participate in ""mining pools""instead of ""solo mining""in order to lower risk and achieve a more steady income. However, this rise of participation in mining pools negatively affects the decentralization levels of most cryptocurrencies. In this work, we look into mining pools from the point of view of a miner: We present an analytical model and implement a computational tool that allows miners to optimally distribute their computational power over multiple pools and PoW cryptocurrencies (i.e. build a mining portfolio), taking into account their risk aversion levels. Our tool allows miners to maximize their risk-adjusted earnings by diversifying across multiple mining pools. Our underlying techniques are drawn from both the areas of financial economy and computer science since we use computer science-based approaches (i.e. optimization techniques) to experimentally prove how parties (and in particular miners) interact with cryptocurrencies in a way of increasing their Sharpe ratio. To showcase our model, we run an experiment in Bitcoin historical data and demonstrate that a miner diversifying over multiple pools, as instructed by our model/tool, receives a higher overall Sharpe ratio (i.e. average excess reward over its standard deviation/volatility). © 2022 The Author(s).","cryptocurrency; mining pools; proof-of-work; risk-sharing","Electronic money; Miners; Risk management; Computational power; Computational tools; Decentralisation; Mining pool; Optimization techniques; Proof of work; Risk aversion; Risk-adjusted; Risk-sharing; Sharpe ratios; Lakes","","","","","CINA; U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS, (205187)","This work was supported by the George Mason Multidisciplinary Research (MDR) Initiative and DHS/CINA (Department of Homeland Security / Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis) Award #205187.

The empirical analysis relies on three regularized linear regression methods, viz. LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic net. We also apply a cross-fit partialing-out LASSO instrumental-variables regression model, as a supplementary approach to handle endogeneity. Findings reveal that trading volume and realized volatility of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency hacks, Ethereum liquidity, and public attention are the most common drivers of liquidity, irrespective of the penalized regression approach and liquidity proxy adopted. Our evidence confirms the paramountcy of cryptocurrency-specific factors over global economic and financial ones in influencing Bitcoin liquidity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive LASSO; Bitcoin; elastic net; LASSO; liquidity determinants","currency market; global economy; information and communication technology; regression analysis","","","","","","","Abdi F., Ranaldo A., A Simple Estimation of bid-ask Spreads from Daily Close, High and Low Prices, The Review of Financial Studies, 30, 12, pp. 4437-255 4480, (2017); Anciaux H., Desagre C., Nicaise N., Petitjean M., Liquidity co-movements and Volatility Regimes in Cryptocurrencies, (2021); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Baker S.R., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Renault T., Twitter-derived Measures of Economic Uncertainty, Working paper, May, (2021); Becker K.G., Finnerty J.E., Tucker A.L., The Intraday Interdependence Structure between U.S. and Japanese Equity Markets, The Journal of Financial Research, 15, 1, pp. 27-37, (1992); Bedowska-Sojka B., Hinc T., Kliber A., Volatility and Liquidity in Cryptocurrency markets—The Causality Approach, Contemporary Trends and Challenges in Finance.

At this time, Bitcoin has the property of a safe-haven asset, and when economic conditions are good and risk aversion is low, Bitcoin has a pro-cyclical nature. At this time, Bitcoin has a stronger property as a medium of exchange. To show the movement law of the bitcoin price, we make a logarithmic linearization of the model and simulation, and the result is consistent with the theoretical analysis. To better understand the role of bitcoin in the real economy, several standard portfolio models are used to measure the similarities and differences between gold and bitcoin in an investment portfolio.

One of the most popular tools in digital economy activities is cryptocurrency, which has led to a rise in digital awareness among people who are more inclined to live their lives electronically and digitally. The aim of this study is to explore the problems and prospects associated with the usage of cryptocurrency and identify ways to address these issues using the governmental roadmap in China and Cambodia. The methods employed in this study include descriptive, explanatory, and comparative analyses. The results demonstrate that the adoption of cryptocurrency presents both opportunities and threats to the Chinese and Cambodian economies. These opportunities and threats need to be carefully considered and balanced by policymakers and stakeholders. The conclusion drawn from the study is that there is still no official acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrency by the Chinese and Cambodian governments. This is primarily due to the fact that the risks and challenges associated with cryptocurrencies are deemed to be greater than the foreseeable opportunities, making them difficult to manage effectively. © Liv S., Awori O.S., Fedyunin A.S., 2023.","bitcoin; blockchain; Cambodia; central bank digital currency; China; cryptocurrency; digital transformation; regulation","","","","","","","","Brynjolfsson E., Kahin B., Understanding the digital economy: data, tools, and research, (2002); Babkin A.

This paper presents a comprehensive review and prospective analysis of this convergence, shedding light on its potential to revolutionize urban environments. We commence with an exploration of the fundamental components of blockchain technology, emphasizing its core principles of decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms. Simultaneously, we trace the historical evolution of blockchain from its origins with Bitcoin to its broad applications in diverse domains. In the context of edge intelligence, we examine how this paradigm shift decentralizes data processing, enabling real-time decision-making and enhancing data security. We elucidate its key components, such as edge devices and analytics algorithms, while highlighting its critical role in reshaping the urban landscape. The crux of this paper lies in the convergence of blockchain and edge intelligence, where we explore its profound implications for the sustainability of smart cities. From efficient energy management and waste reduction to improved transportation and green infrastructure, this convergence empowers smart cities to optimize resource usage, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the quality of life for their residents. Through a prospective analysis, we anticipate emerging trends and innovations that will shape the future of smart city sustainability, including AI integration, 5G connectivity, and circular economy initiatives. As smart cities continue to evolve, they stand at the forefront of addressing urbanization challenges while fostering sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous urban environments. © 2023, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

In fact, the protagonist of both novels, Jean Detrez, is a senior official of the European Commission and expert in “strategic foresight”, writing reports on the collective future. At a time when the power of virtualisation and distancing are at their peak, Toussaint questions himself and us on sensitive topics: what are the real powers of the European Commission and the increasingly digital and inward-looking world, which seems to ignore the difference between a collective and individual future? Nevertheless, the link between the two novels seems to dwell in the power of emotions. This paper aims to study Toussaint’s “secrets d’écriture” (C’est vous l’écrivain) in order to focus on how power is staged in both novels. By addressing the dialogue between literature and Belgian history, we also aim to demonstrate how Brussels’ history ends up deeply intertwined with Europe’s history, almost sidelining the history of Belgium altogether. © 2023 Brepols Publishers.

However, reduced frictions in global capital flows could also result in more capital flow and exchange rate volatility, which is of particular concern for emerging market economies.There will be greater competition among fiat currencies and certain private currencies such as stablecoins in their roles as mediums of exchange for payment and settlement of domestic as well as cross-border transactions. However, neither the advent of CBDCs nor the lowering of barriers to international financial flows will do much on their own to reorder the international monetary system or the balance of power among major currencies. Currencies such as the US dollar that are dominant stores of value will remain so because that dominance rests not just on the issuing country’s economic size and financial market depth, but also on a strong institutional foundation that is essential for maintaining investors’ trust in a currency. © The Author(s) 2023.

Previous work has addressed the economic properties of Bitcoin with regards to its hedging or diversification properties. However, the surge of many alternatives, applications, and decentralized finance services on a variety of blockchain networks requires a re-examination of those properties, including indexes from outside the big economies and the inclusion of a variety of cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we report the results of studying the most representative cryptocurrency of each consensus mechanism by trading volume, forming a list of twenty-four cryptocurrencies from the 1st of January 2018 to the 30th of September 2022. Using the Baur and McDermott model, we examine hedge, safe haven, and diversifier properties of all assets for all G7 country’s major indexes as well as all BRICS major indexes breaking it down by two attributes: kind of blockchain technology and pre/during COVID health crisis. Results show that both attributes play an important role in the hedge, safe haven, and diversifier properties associated with the asset. Concretely: stablecoins appear to be the only ones to maintain hedge property in most analyzed markets pre- and during-COVID; Bitcoin investment properties shifted after the COVID crisis started; China and Russia stopped being correlated with the cryptocurrency after the COVID crisis hit. © 2022 by the authors.","blockchain privacy; blockchain technology; BRICS; cryptocurrency; diversifier; G7; hedging; safe haven","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","We examined a study funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG]) with 11 participants, in which the influence of additional standardised dietary components on the microbiota of the oral biofilm was investigated over 15 months.

It may replace gold as a hedge against inflation and become a new investment asset for financial management. The investment relationship with gold has increasingly important research value and practical significance. This paper modeled daily price flow data from 11 September 2016 to 10 September 2021 to help market traders determine whether they need to buy, hold, or sell assets in their portfolios daily. The model predicts price fluctuations through linear regression prediction of machine learning, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. In the linear regression prediction, the goodness of fit of gold is 89.44%, and the goodness of fit of Bitcoin is 98.43%. In the test set prediction of KNN algorithm, the goodness of fit of gold is 97.25%, and the goodness of fit of Bitcoin is 95.06%. Based on this, the optimal investment strategy and the initial investment value are obtained. Empirical analysis shows that bitcoin price volatility and gold price volatility have a strong substitution effect; gold and currency used will be a suitable combination of hedging, which will bring momentum for the development of the market economy and become an important force in the sustainable development of a high-quality-driven economy. © 2022 by the authors.","bitcoin; gold; KNN; linear regression prediction","economic conditions; inflation; machine learning; prediction; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103550); Southwest Minzu University, SWUN, (2021PTJS24, 2021XJTD01); Southwest Minzu University Research Startup Fund, (RQD2021064)","This research is supported by the Southwest Minzu University Research Startup Fund (Grant No. RQD2021064) and also supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Southwest Minzu University (Grant Number: 2021XJTD01, 2021PTJS24).","Ciaian P., Rajcaniova M., Kancs D.A., The economics of BitCoin price formation, Appl.

Can blockchain innovation promote total factor productivity? Based on the blockchain patent data of Chinese-listed firms from 2012 to 2020, we show that blockchain innovation activities can improve the total factor productivity (TFP) of enterprises and verify its robustness using instrumental variable approach, system GMM and Heckman’s two-step selection method. Results of mediation effect model show that enterprises’ blockchain innovation activities mainly improve TFP through three channels: alleviating financing constraints, reducing supply chain concentration and inefficient investment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that electronic digital data processing blockchain patents have the highest practical value, while financial blockchain innovation inhibits the improvement of TFP in China. Blockchain innovation can bring positive effects on the TFP of manufacturing enterprises and leasing and business service enterprises. The increase in TFP of leasing and business service enterprises brought by blockchain innovation is nearly 70 times that of the baseline regression. We further provide blockchain innovation development suggestions for Chinese government based on these conclusions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Blockchain; financing constraints; inefficient investment; supply chain; total factor productivity","China; business service; finance; government; industrial enterprise; information technology; innovation; manufacturing; supply chain management; technological development; total factor productivity","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (ZD072)","The work was supported in part by The National Social Science Fund of China [Grant number 20&ZD072].","Balasubramanian N., Sivadasan J., What Happens When Firms Patent?

Exploiting cross-country variation in prescheduled announcement timing, I isolate how monetary policy announcements affect local Bitcoin demand using an event-study design on a panel of 26 emerging economies. I find that monetary policy announcements increase both measures of local Bitcoin attention and local Bitcoin trade volume, but only on days when the public is abnormally attentive to inflation. These announcement-induced Bitcoin trading spikes are only significant in countries that are not normally accustomed to inflation risk. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; Emerging economies; Event study; Investor attention; Monetary policy","","","","","","","","(2020); Baqaee D.R., Asymmetric inflation expectations, downward rigidity of wages, and asymmetric business cycles, J.

While blockchain technologies primarily have been associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, they are changing the arts sector, particularly dance and choreography. This transformation has significant implications for understanding the valorization of Black labor and aesthetics. By examining two distinct choreographic initiatives, we can grasp the profound impact of blockchain cultural production and distribution ecosystems. One example is the work of JaQuel Knight, renowned for choreographing iconic music videos, including Beyoncé’s. Knight's efforts to copyright his dances and empower Black choreographers reflect a shift towards artist ownership of dance steps. Another case study involves the Renegade dance, initially popularized on TikTok. Despite its viral success, choreographer Jalaiah Harmon struggled for recognition. Now, with the advent of dance Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), artists can monetize their work and bridge the gap between labor and circulation. These innovative legal and financial pathways mark the emergence of crypto-choreographies, enabling Black artists to reimagine and carry out a post-extractive dance world. This transcends conventional debates of dance appreciation versus appropriation, signaling a transformative shift in aesthetic economies and the limits of choreographic copyright law. © 2023, Juan Manuel Aldape Muñoz.

However, Tor also facilitates cybercriminal actors who utilize it for illicit activities. Quantifying the size and nature of such activity is challenging, as Tor complicates indexing by design. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate both size and nature of illicit commercial activity on the Dark Web. We demonstrate this based on crawling Tor for single-vendor Dark Web Shops, i.e., niche storefronts operated by single cybercriminal actors or small groups. Based on data collected from Tor, we show that just in 2021, Dark Web Shops generated at least 113 million USD in revenue. Sexual abuse is the top illicit revenue category, followed by financial crime at a great distance. We also compare Dark Web Shops' activity with a large Dark Web Marketplace, showing that these are parallel economies. Our methodology contributes towards automated analysis of illicit activity in Tor. Furthermore our analysis sheds light on the evolving Dark Web Shop ecosystem and provides insights into evidence-based policymaking regarding criminal Dark Web activity. © 2013 IEEE.","bitcoin; Computer crime; dark web","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Crime; Data privacy; Malware; Network security; Block-chain; Cybercriminals; Dark web; Freedom of speech; Peer-to-peer computing; Privacy; Privacy and freedoms; User privacy; Web shop; Ecosystems","","","","","European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (679158)","This work was supported in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under Starting Grant ResolutioNet ERC-StG-679158.","Aas J., Barnes R., Case B., Durumeric Z., Eckersley P., Flores-Lopez A., Halderman J.A., Hoffman-Andrews J., Kasten J., Rescorla E., Schoen S., Warren B., Let's encrypt: An automated certificate authority to encrypt the entire web, Proc.

Bitcoin and other version of it (known as Altcoins) are traded everyday at various cryptocurrency exchanges and have drawn the interest of many investors. These new type of assets are characterised by wild swings in prices and this can lead to great profit as well as large losses. To respond to these dynamics, crypto investors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of optimal portfolio selection. This paper presents a portfolio selection based on COGARCH and regular vine copula which are able to capture features such as abrupt jumps in prices, heavy-tailed distribution and dependence structure respectively, with the optimal portfolio achieved through the stochastic heuristic algorithm differential evolution known for its global search solution ability. This method shows great performance as compared with other available models and can achieve up to 50% of total returns in some periods of optimization. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","COGARCH;

Daily time series data on four different types of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and BMB) were employed. The data covers the period from 1 January 2019–31 December 2021. The study employed the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC GARCH) and Bayesian liner regression model to investigate time-varying correlations among the variables. Empirical findings suggest that stock market volatility has a positive impact on the returns of BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, it has a negative impact on Tether. Expectedly, cybercrime poses negative impacts on the returns of BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum but could be said to have no impact on the returns of Tether. The study concludes that ongoing efforts to reduce cybercrime activities need to be strengthened to further the use of digital currencies. © 2022 by the authors.","BLR; cryptocurrencies; cybercrime; DCC; stock market volatility","","","","","","","","Bouri E., Gupta R., Tiwari A.K., Roubaud D., Does Bitcoin hedge global uncertainty?

This investigation employs bootstrap full-and sub-sample techniques to probe time-varying interrelation between global supply chain pressure (GSCP) and bitcoin price (BP), and further answer if “digital gold” could resist the strains of global supply chain. The empirical outcomes suggest that GSCP positively and negatively affects BP. The positive influence points out that high GSCP might boost the international bitcoin market, driving BP to rise, which indicates that “digital gold” could resist the pressures of global supply chain. But the negative effect of GSCP on BP could not support the above view, mainly affected by the weak purchasing power and more valuable assets, which is not consistent with the assumption of the inter-temporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). In turn, GSCP is adversely affected by BP, highlighting that the international bitcoin market may be viewed as a stress reliever for the global supply chain. Against a backdrop of the deteriorative Russia-Ukraine war and the intensifying global supply chain crisis, the above conclusions could bring significative lessons to the public, enterprises and related economies. © 2023 The Author(s).","bitcoin price; digital gold; global supply chain; Granger causal relation; sub-sample","","","","","","","","Adekoya O.-B., Oliyide J.-A., Yaya O.-S., Al-Faryan M.-A.-S., Does oil connect differently with prominent assets during war?

We consider MAC global solar energy index (RMGS) and ISE global wind energy index (RIGW) as proxies of the energy market and use bitcoin and the European energy exchange carbon index (REEX) for the cryptocurrency and carbon market. Employing the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), Baruník and Krehlík (2018), and wavelet coherence econometric techniques, we find that the energy market (RMGS) has the highest connectedness derived from other asset classes, and bitcoin (RBTC) has the least connectedness. Concurrently, we find that the risk transmission is heterogeneous in different scales as the short period has less connectedness than the medium and long run. We conclude that the overall diversification opportunity among green bonds, energy stock, bitcoin, and the carbon market is more in the short-run than in the medium and long-run. In summary, our findings on the green bond market will provide investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers with critical insight into ensuring a sustainable financial market. © 2022, The Author(s).","Carbon market; Connectedness; Cryptocurrency; Diversification; Energy market; Green bond","Carbon; COVID-19; Cryptosporidiosis; Humans; Solar Energy; Wind; carbon; carbon emission; currency; econometrics; empirical analysis; energy market; green economy; wavelet analysis; cryptosporidiosis; human; solar energy; wind","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ","","","","","Abakah E.J.A., Addo E., Gil-Alana L.A., Tiwari A.K., Re-examination of international bond market dependence: evidence from a pair copula approach, Int Rev Financ Anal, (2021); Abakah E.J.A., Caporale G.M., Gil-Alana L.A., Cryptocurrencies, technology stocks, Covid-19 and U.S. policy responses: a fractional integration analysis., (2022); Ahmed Z., Caglar A.E., Murshed M., A path towards environmental sustainability: the role of clean energy and democracy in ecological footprint of Pakistan, J Clean Prod, 358, (2022); Antonakakis N., Chatziantoniou I., Gabauer D., Refined measures of dynamic connectedness based on time-varying parameter vector autoregressions, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 13, 4, (2020); Arif M., Naeem M.A., Farid S., Nepal R., Jamasb T., Diversifier Or More?

Therefore, the volatility risks of fiat currencies, as well as of bitcoins and altcoins, are increasing. The study focuses on analyzing the risk of cryptocurrencies vitality under global uncertainty. To that end, To meet the study’s aim, a range of general methods, including descriptive, comparison, analysis and observational methods are utilize. According to the results, the exchange rate fluctuations of bitcoin to the US dollar and bitcoin to the euro are synchronous, which to a greater extent indicates the actual absence of the impact of bitcoin on the world's fiat money. At the same time, the cross-rates of fiat currencies are in direct interaction, which confirms the actual absence of the impact of bitcoin on the stability of the euro or dollar monetary currencies. The conducted research made it possible to identify the main risks and threats associated with the regulation of crypto markets at the level of individual jurisdictions. It implies the improvement of the current digital legislation to regulate the activities of crypto exchanges in order to forestall the growth of the shadow economy. © 2022, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

The main explanation for the adoption of stablecoins is their one-to-one peg to various currencies and commodities. Previous studies have relied on the relationships among cryptocurrencies and thus could not disentangle the country-level macroeconomic effects of stablecoins from the effects of other cryptocurrencies. Using data from January 2006 to December 2019, we decompose the correlation between cryptocurrencies and their effects on the economy due to (a) shocks to stablecoins and (b) shocks to Bitcoin. Contrary to assumptions, stablecoins do not maintain their peg in “crash times” but do promote economic growth. Bitcoin's volatility deanchors investor expectations, disrupts markets, and destabilizes key macroeconomic factors. Our novel findings indicate that stablecoin adoption should not be based only on a one-to-one assumption and reveal the mechanism of key gaps by a prudential authority. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; Connectedness; Forecast; Macroeconometrics; Policy objective; Stablecoin adoption","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Carvalho V.M., Ozdaglar A., Tahbaz-Salehi A., The network origins of aggregate fluctuations, Econometrica, 80, pp. 1977-2016, (2012); Acemoglu D., Ozdaglar A., Tahbaz-Salehi A., Systemic risk and stability in financial networks, Am.

Because it is changing how economic transactions are carried out, the blockchain is one of the technical developments that has a lot of promise for this progress. The public record of the Bitcoin blockchain provides dispersed users with evidence of transaction ownership by publishing all transaction data from block reward transactions to unspent transaction outputs. Attacks on the public ledger, on the other hand, are a result of the fact that all transaction information are exposed. De-anonymization attacks allow users to link transaction entities and acquire user privacy through specified transaction amounts. As a result, in light of the Bitcoin blockchain system’s privacy issues, this scheme combines the concept of coin mixing with encrypted transaction technology to create a truly anonymous blockchain system that preserves the payer identity and transaction amount privacy. The one-way aggregated signature technique of Boneh, Gentry, and Lynn systematically embeds the notion of mixing into the whole block. The homomorphic encryption approach of Boneh, Goh, and Nissim allows miners to check the legality of encrypted transactions. Miners will validate transactions, conceal transactions, and package transactions as entities in the scheme. Finally, this technique was chosen after a comparison of several privacy-preserving blockchain schemes. It not only ensures complete anonymity, but also keeps transaction storage overhead to a minimum. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Economic development is also inseparable from the growing technology, for example in transaction procedures in a matter. Bitcoin came up with a new innovation in the form of a cryptocurrency that uses a payment network from user to user. Crypto has become a phenomenon nowadays. Based on the results of the Global Web Index Survey, 10% of internet users in Indonesia already own digital currencies, it can be said that Indonesia is ranked 5th most crypto users in the world. Crypto or can be called crytocurrency has a fairly high risk. Then kirpto has a change in value that is only enthusiasm at any time. Krip toalso has a lack of regulation and still leaves legality issues. This research was conducted to determine the existence of bitcoin trading to the national economy. The use of bitcoin over time is increasing in Indonesia. For this reason, before the use of bitcoin is increasing, we must understand the influence and impact of bitcoin trading on the national economy. Only nine countries have legalized bitcoin, it is questionable why many countries have not legalized bitcoin. This study aims to find out how bitcoin trading conditions in Indonesia. The results of this journal will discuss the effect of bitcoin trading on the national economy even though in Indonesia it is prohibited and recognized as legal tender. This can be viewed from several factors such as from the nominal side of bitcoin, which is considered excessive, especially in the picture of the economic crisis. © 2022 Author(s).","Bitcoin; Indonesian Currency Law; Indonesian Legal System; Trade","","","","","","","","Aalborg Halvor Aarhus, Molnar Peter, de Vries Jon Erik, What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin?, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 255-265, (2019); Alam Syamsu, Jamil Muh, Syamsir Andi, Digital Currency in Indonesia (Prospects and Challenges in Inclusive Financial Reviews), Jurnal Administrare: Jurnal Pemikiran Ilmiah dan Pendidikan Administrasi Perkantoran, 9, 2, pp. 515-428, (2022); Amsyar Izwan, Et al., The Challenge of Cryptocurrency in the Era of the Digital Revolution: A Review of Systematic Literature, Aptisi Transactions on Technopreneurship (ATT), 2, 2, pp. 153-159, (2020); Badawi A.

According to the QQ technique, we estimate how the quantiles of cryptocurrencies affect the foreign exchange market quantiles. It provides a broader view of the entire dependence structure between the forex markets and digital currencies than traditional methods. Our empirical analysis indicates a positive connection between foreign exchange currencies and cryptocurrencies for all nine currencies, particularly Bitcoin, at low, high, and middle tail quantiles. However, differences are present between economies and across quantiles of virtual currencies and fiat currencies for each economy. This heterogeneity is due to variations in economic structure, legal recognition by governments, associated risk, and monetary or macroeconomic policy changes that affect the trading of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. © 2022","Cryptocurrencies; Foreign exchange markets; Quantile on Quantile approach","","","","","","Prince Sultan University, PSU","The third author would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University and for paying the article processing charges (APC) for this publication.

Examples of such inhibitors include the bullwhip effect, new product lines, high inventory, and restrictive data flows. These bottlenecks can force manufacturers to source more raw materials and increase production significantly. Also, restrictive data flow in a complex global SC network generally slows down the movement of goods and services. The use of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in SC management (SCM) demonstrates the potentials to reduce these bottlenecks through transparency, decentralization, and optimizations in data management. These technologies promise to enhance the trustworthiness of entities within the SC, ensure the accuracy of data-driven operations, and enable existing SCM processes to migrate from a linear to a fully circular economy. This article presents a comprehensive review of 111 articles published in the public domain in the use and efficacy of DLT in SC. It acts as a roadmap for current and future researchers who focus on SC security management to better understand the integration of digital technologies such as DLT. We clustered these articles using standard descriptors linked to trustworthiness, namely, immutability, transparency, traceability, and integrity.  © 2022 IEEE.","Cyber resilience; data sharing; distributed ledger technology; industry 4.0; supply chain (SC) management; trustworthiness","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cybersecurity; Data privacy; Data transfer; Distributed ledger; Industry 4.0; Information management; Network security; Scalability; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Transparency; Cybe resilience; Data Sharing; Dataflow; Distributed ledg technology; Privacy; Resilience; Security; Security management; Supply chain security; Trustworthiness; Smart contract","","","","","","","Chowdhury Et Al M.J.M., A comparative analysis of distributed ledger technology platforms, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 167930-167943, (2019); Yu F.R., Liu J., He Y., Si P., Zhang Y., Virtualization for distributed ledger technology (vdlt), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 25019-25028, (2018); Shahaab A., Lidgey B., Hewage C., Khan I., Applicability and appropriateness of distributed ledgers consensus protocols in public and private sectors: A systematic review, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 43622-43636, (2019); Bellini E., Iraqi Y., Damiani E., Blockchain-based distributed trust and reputation management systems: A survey, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 21127-21151, (2020); Epiphaniou G., Pillai P., Bottarelli M., Al-Khateeb H., Hammoudesh M., Maple C., Electronic regulation of data sharing and processing using smart ledger technologies for supply-chain security, IEEE Trans.

However, the price of virtual currency represented by Bitcoin has random fluctuation characteristics, which is extremely misleading for time series prediction. In this paper, a virtual currency quantitative trading model is established, which uses a convolution long short term memory (ConvLSTM) deep learning method to predict the transaction price, and uses the evaluation model composed of Chandler momentum oscillator (CMO), percentage price oscillator (PPO), stop and reverse(SAR) and other economic indicators to make further decisions. The model quantitatively classifies the random wandering characteristics by fusing economic indicators and extracts the symmetric economic laws among them, making full use of deep learning methods to extract spatial and temporal features within the data. The 2016–2021 Bitcoin value dataset published on Kaggle was used for simulated investment. The results show that compared with other existing decision models, it shows better performance and robustness, and shows good stability in dealing with the interdependence of long-term and short-term data. Our work provides a new idea for short-term prediction of long time series data affected by multiple complex factors: coupling deep learning methods with prior knowledge to complete prediction and decision making. © 2022 by the authors.","ConvLSTM; quantitative trading; random fluctuations; symmetric economy","","","","","","Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education Service Local Special Research Program, (22JC019)","This work has been financed by Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education Service Local Special Research Program (No.22JC019).

Several terms are synonyms for digital currency like digital money, electronic money, and cyber cash. Accurate prediction of the digital currency is an urgent necessity due to its impacts on the economic community. The electronic economy is very dangerous and must be approached with great caution, so as to avoid or minimize the risks that occur in such cases. Deep neural network (DNN) algorithm was improved to predict the Bitcoin price and then achieve the main goal of reducing financial risks to proceed with electronic business, and good estimation was achieved by using informative data such as transactions and currency return. The proposed method extracted features of related Bitcoin and used the informative ones. Transaction plan considered building nodes in terms of network. Development of deep learning algorithms opens the horizons for the development of electronic businesses that use digital currency. The proposed method achieved worthy results in terms of accuracy (53.4%) and correct prediction (MSE 1.02) and offers the prospect of other research in this area. © 2022 Si Chen.","","Bitcoin; Deep neural networks; Finance; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Accurate prediction; Digital forms; Digital world; Economic community; Electronic goods; Financial risk analysis; Financial risks; Neural networks algorithms; Risk assessment","","","","","","","Science Electronic Publishing S., Working Paper, 19-26, (2019); Kyriazis N.A., Herding behaviour in digital currency markets: An integrated survey and empirical estimation, Heliyon, 6, 8, (2020); Huynh K., Molnar J., Shcherbakov O., Yu Q., Demand for Payment Services and Consumer Welfare: The Introduction of A Central Bank Digital Currency.

This study investigated Bitcoin’s persistence and hedging properties in the pre-COVID era to establish its efficiency and safety by testing relevant data. We evaluated the role of persistence in Bitcoin trading to highlight its efficiency. The GPH estimator and ARFIMA were used to map the evolving efficiency of the Bitcoin price. Our analysis of intra-day data exhibited the presence of an anti-persistence effect, following the popular conclusion of momentum and speculative trading in the Bitcoin market. The second section of this study evaluated whether Bitcoin played the role of a hedge and an asset of protection in a global portfolio manager’s portfolio during extreme market volatility. Using the Threshold GARCH (TGARCH), we evaluated the trading correlation between Bitcoin prices and four major indices, namely S & P 500, FTSE, Hang Seng, and Nikkei, on daily and weekly data. We identified the time-varying hedge and safety properties of Bitcoin: Volatility, speculation, less-traded history, and lack of regulatory infrastructure. Our findings added to the literature by testing the efficiency of Bitcoin in major developed economies using returns of high-frequency data, along with daily returns. We also considered extreme movements in the currency to check its hedging and protection properties in a portfolio of developed market stocks. We recommended that investors be cautious when combining this currency with different stock markets based on our findings. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The recent and ongoing COVID pandemic provides an opportunity to assess how crtypocurrency fares as a store of value, as the pandemic has disrupted economies, possibly inducing speculative motives for holding cryptocurrency. This paper sought to establish if Bitcoin and Ethereum generated any excess returns over the recent time period covering the pandemic. Parameter estimates from a Capital Asset Pricing Model revealed that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum realized excess returns during the COVID pandemic. This suggests that to the extent that a standard and generally acceptable medium of exchange has a speculative component to its demand, crytopcurency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may not be good candidates as a medium of exhhange. © 2022, Nigerian Economic Society.

Using a partial wavelet coherence framework to capture the bivariate co-movement, our findings show strong (weak) positive co-movements among GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) and DJSWI returns, where GBs (sustainable cryptocurrencies) have a heterogeneous leading role in the short-term and long-term horizons. Results indicate moderate positive (negative) co-movement among GBs and sustainable cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and DJSWI in the short run (long run). Overall, the results show GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) acts as a diversifier for Bitcoin and sustainable cryptocurrencies in most cases (DJSWI). However, increasing Bitcoin returns adversely impacts the DJSWI in the long run. Findings are equally imperative for green investors, crypto traders and policymakers, where investors and traders can earn financial and social returns, and policy-makers can deploy suitable policies for the development of sustainable cryptocurrency mining processes.

We run cointegration and error-correction econometric models for each country, analyzing both the long-term and short-term interactions between Bitcoin volume and time deposits. Our findings indicate a negative association between Bitcoin volume and term deposits in all the MINT countries, except Mexico. This suggests that individual investors in economically and financially unstable nations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as an alternative investment option. The observed effects, while currently modest, highlight the potential threats posed by decentralized cryptocurrencies to the monetary systems of emerging economies, impacting the stability of the banking industry and overall economic growth.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.","Bitcoin; currency substitution; MINT; term deposits","","","","","","","","Adebayo T.S., Awosusi A.A., Adeshola I., Determinants of co2 emissions in emerging markets: An empirical evidence from mint economies, International Journal of Renewable Energy Development, 9, 3, (2020); Attila J.G., Does bank deposits volatility react to political instability in developing countries?, Finance Research Letters, 49, (2022); Balcilar M., Bouri E., Gupta R., Roubaud D., Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility?

The conclusions of the study are useful for cryptocurrency and NFT issuers, but also for investors on the financial market who are reconfiguring their portfolios with increasing frequency, and use these new assets for speculative or hedging purposes based on blockchain technology. The results highlighted relationships between NFTs and Ethereum, between Ethereum and Crypto Coin, and between Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ethereum being a bridge between all four. Therefore, NFTs present a relationship with Ethereum, the NFTs price had a causal effect on the price of Ethereum. © 2022 by the authors.","Bitcoin; Crypto Coin; digitalization; Ethereum; granger causality; NFT; VAR","","","","","","","","Akkaya B., Jermsittiparsert K., Abid Malik M., Kocyigit Y., Emerging Trends in and Strategies for Industry 4.0 during and beyond COVID-19, (2021); Amin H., Malik M.A., Akkaya B., Development and Validation of Digital Literacy Scale (DLS) and its Implication for Higher Education, Int.

For this purpose, by adopting the social network analysis methodological approach, it considers the geographical network of Bitcoin transactions as a proxy to measure the national level of fintech development and compares it with a set of economic freedom indicators related to the top 70 world economies. The analysis revealed significant relationships between the performed network centrality measures and national levels of economic freedom. In particular, as confirmed by the implemented multilevel regression models, high levels of freedom to trade internationally combined with a restrained value of inflation and low administrative requirements can be considered as determining factors for fintech development. The study also showed a large number of Bitcoin transactions conducted in those countries characterized by fewer capital controls and restrictions, a result that feeds suspicions of illegal behavior, such as money laundering or terrorism financing, carried out through the use of cryptocurrencies. Findings of this research might be strategic for fintech entrepreneurship and policymakers interested in designing policies that aim to foster innovative sectors while ensuring the legality of financial flows. © 2019, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Fintech; Social network analysis","","","","","","","","Adhami S., Giudici G., Martinazzi S., Why do businesses go crypto?

This exploratory and explanatory research has been performed in the context of digitization of Bangladesh economy. The research question is whether the transformation of Bangladesh towards the digital economy can act effectively and efficiently for the benefits of the society and the economy. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted. Sixteen hypotheses were tested based on the Chi-square test. The time period of the study was from April 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. The Chi-square test findings were significant for the following null hypotheses: Internet of Thinking will not bring benefits of the human beings; robots are not needed for industries; big data cannot be used for the business intelligence; artificial intelligence (AI) is not effective; bitcoin transactions should not be allowed; the banking sector is not relatively digitalized; chatbots do not need to be used in banks; drones cannot be used for commercial purpose; robots cannot be used for education purpose; farmers must not learn to yield wirelessly. Another six null hypotheses were rejected. Fear of losing employment was the key obstruction to execute the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) in the country as revealed from the study. Proper information and communication technology (ICT) based education, preparation and knowledge were required. Good governance and regulation should be established with the help of digitization in Bangladesh. The study is suggested to answer the research question, if the benefit from transforming the society to the digital economy may outweigh negative impacts and turn threats into opportunities, reduce demand for labor and disguised unemployment and narrow down the scope of creating new employment opportunities in the country. The potential unlocking system in the global market is feasible through ensuring digitization of Bangladesh society. © 2020 The Author.","Artificial Intelligence; Bangladesh; Digital Economy; Digitization; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Labor Demand; Technological Changes; Telecommunications","","","","","","Asian Development Bank, ADB; University Grants Commission of Bangladesh, UGC","The digital economy refers to the financial arrangement supported by digital computing skills. Real-time gross settlement in most of the banks in Bangladesh has been working. Comparatively in the financial and the banking sectors, electronic banking and digitization were introduced. However, the cost of e-banking is much higher for lower-and middle-income segments of the society. Bangladesh will start to introduce 5G between 2020 and 2025 in three phases. Nine universities in Bangladesh have been moving to implement advanced ICT education funded by ADB with the help of University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh. ACI has two apps – Khamari (farming) and Fosali (cropping) for the agriculture sector; through these apps need to be more user-friendly and there should be synchronization between the agricultural production processes to marketing – each stage of these may be more popular. However, government apps on Krishok (farmer) may help to boost up the transparency of the government buying and selling in the agricultural sector. DESHIZ (“Top 8 digital wallets”, 2018) pointed out top 8 digital wallets to go cashless in Bangladesh: bKash, iPay, Rocket, NexusPay, Upay, GPAY, Easy.com.bd, Dmoney. Further, „Digital Haat‟ was introduced in 2020, as the first digital cattle market in Dhaka city. Food for Nation was started by the government of Bangladesh in the year 2020 as the first market for agriculture.","Ali M. M., E-business and online banking in Bangladesh: An analysis, (2010); Ali M.

From shells, to metals, to paper, the technology of money has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of human society. The twenty-first century is witnessing yet another evolution in the technology of money: digital currencies. Although political economy scholarship has begun to focus on digital currencies, this research has largely focused on single early examples like Bitcoin. I argue that this generally narrow focus has obscured important degrees of variation among digital currencies and, by extension, has omitted important lines of research on digital currencies as a familiar evolution in the technology of money. In this article, I revisit the history of digital currencies with explicit attention to not only economic inefficiencies but also political power structures and offer a new typology for theoretically organizing digital currencies along dimensions relevant to practitioners of political economy. I illustrate that variation along these typological dimensions produces important differences among different digital currencies and, relatedly, I explore the implications this has for digital currencies' externalities and governance demands. Drawing on this typology, I conclude with a proposed research agenda for the political economy of digital currencies.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

COVID-19, which began in China in 2019 and spread to many countries of the world, created a crisis not only in the global health system but also in the international financial markets and economy. The purpose of this study is to analyze the contagious effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volatility of selected financial variables such as Bitcoin, gold, oil price, and exchange rates and the connections between the volatilities of these variables during the pandemic. For this aim, we use the ARMA-EGARCH model to measure the impact of volatility and shocks. In other words, it is aimed to measure whether the impact of the shock on the financial variables of the contagiousness of the epidemic is also transmitted to the markets. The data was collected from secondary and daily data from September 2th 2019 to December 20th, 2020. It can be said that the findings obtained have statistically significant effects on the conditional variability of the variables. Therefore, there are findings that the shocks in the market are contaminated with each other. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","COVID-19; Crude Oil; Exchange Rate; Gold.

Inside two years of its tranquil dispatch in 2009, Bitcoin developed to involve billions of US dollars of financial incentive regardless of just careless examination of the framework's plan. In the meantime an enormous and lively open-source network has proposed and sent various adjustments and augmentations. However, the GCC region remains unexplored in terms of cryptocurrency research. Hence, we provide the first survey on cryptocurrency in the GCC economy. In this exploratory study, we used an online questionnaire survey that was collected from 610 individuals and investors from all Gulf countries namely: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and UAE. The research instrument consists of 24 different questions that measure respondents’ opinions and attitudes toward cryptocurrency in the GCC. The findings reveal that most respondents in the GCC have heard or read about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, a vast majority of them (85%) do not own cryptocurrency. In addition, investing in cryptocurrency is more risky and less profitable than investing in the stock market. Also, if cryptocurrency is government regulated but remained intangible, it would increase their interest in cryptocurrency, and in near future i.e. within 5 years, cryptocurrency will be worth more than today. © 2020 IJSTR.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Fintech; GCC Economy; Stock Market","","","","","","","","Grimbergen R., Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency, Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal, (2011); Subramanian R., Chino T., The state of cryptocurrencies: Their issues and policy interactions, Journal of International Technology & Information Management, 24, 3, pp. 25-40, (2016); Bailis P., Song H., Research for Practice: Cryptocurrencies, Blockchains, and Smart Contracts; Hardware for Deep Learning, Communications of the ACM, 60, 5, pp. 48-51, (2017); Ivaschenko A.I., Using Cryptocurrency in the Activities of Ukrainian Small and Medium Enterprises in order to Improve their Investment Attractiveness, Problems of Economy, 5, 3, pp. 267-273, (2016); Hileman G., Rauchs M., Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study, (2017); Eric T., Do Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin Have a Future?

Cryptocurrencies are a challenging area in finance that requires additional attention from the academic community as they can have a potentially large impact on society and the economy. This study aims to investigate the usability of digital money among the citizens of Saudi Arabia. Various factors that are related to user behavior and have an impact on user intent towards cryptocurrencies based on a combined approach are analyzed. The basis from which the authors started is The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), together with four other constructions: perceived risk (consisting of privacy risk, financial risk, and security risk), perception of enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and personal innovation. The method used to collect the data is a questionnaire. The results showed that variables such as subjective norms, security risk, perception of utility, and enjoyment influence the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. These variables include the perception of pleasure as well as the perception of utility. Copyright © 2021. Saad ALAKLABI and Kyeong KANG.

Although it now seems to be an impossible and hard-to-accept scenario, especially by the big players in the industry, the pilot projects so far demonstrate that blockchain can play a major role in the future energy market, even if the technology is still in the first stages of the adoption life cycle. This article attempts to describe a solution to provide alternative irrigation systems for small farmers. The solution involves creating associations of small farmers that will use green energy from photovoltaic panels for the irrigation of agricultural lands. The efficiency of the proposed system can be monitored not only through digital hardware connected to photovoltaic panels and water pumps, but also by using the new blockchain technology that stimulates innovation and growth in the energy and a high level of automation though smart contracts. To accelerate the transition to the green energy economy, a SolarCoin version similar to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has also been proposed, which is a utility token that creates new possibilities for energy and water trading. © 2020 by the authors.","Blockchain; Floating photovoltaic panels; Irrigation system; Photovoltaic water pumping systems (PWPS); SCADA; Solar coin","agricultural land; detection method; energy market; irrigation system; photovoltaic system; power generation; solar radiation","","","","","CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI; Ministry of Research and Innovation; Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS; Ministerul Educaţiei Naţionale, MEN; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI, (PCCDI2017-0332); Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI; Ministerio de EducaciÃ³n de la NaciÃ³n; King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, KMUTNB, (KMUTNB-63-KNOW-040); King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, KMUTNB; Ministerul Cercetării şi Inovării, MCI","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was partially funded by Research Center “Modeling and Simulation of the Systems and Processes” based on grants of the Ministry of National Education and Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI within PNCDI III “Increasing the institutional capacity of bioeconomic research for the innovative exploitation of the indigenous vegetal resources in order to obtain horticultural products with high added value” PN-III P1-1.2-PCCDI2017-0332.

This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It introduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to several other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a non-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The analysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly correlated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a marginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the interactions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a causality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures and shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across currencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of significative interactions. Overall this study uncovers a complex and rich structure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other both instantaneously and with lead–lag causal relations. A major finding is that minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in shaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level of noise and the short time-series I verified that these networks are significant with all links statistically validated and with a structural organisation consistently reproduced across all networks. © The Author(s) 2019.","Causality; Cryptocurrencies; Dependency; Networks","","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P031730/1, H2020-ICT-2018-2 825215); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","Many thanks to the PsychSignal team for providing the sentiment data.

The innovative and technological financial instruments are inspiring individuals and expert investors to investigate the broader investment spectrum, and consequently diversify their portfolios. Going beyond the conventional portfolios and developing state-of-the-art strategies that comply with the ever-changing financial and technological advancements are the keys to long term sustainability. Therefore, to cater to the needs of all segments of the society, the investment strategies during the fourth industrial revolution demand exposure to technological and digital financial innovations. This study investigates the impact of diversification with the addition of five cryptocurrencies from November 2015 to November 2019 on four traditional asset portfolios. The results show that the diversification increased the returns in most of the cases, and reduced the portfolio volatility in all portfolios, and also provided higher returns as compared to the traditional portfolios for the same level of risk. This study also revealed that the results might improve when short sales are allowed. Moreover, we can conclude that the addition of multiple cryptocurrencies in a portfolio provides enhanced results for diversification, and Ethereum provides a better diversification opportunity as compared to Bitcoin. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cryptocurrency; Financial innovation; Financial markets; Investment; Portfolio diversification; Technological innovation","Finance; Financial data processing; Industry 4.0; Financial innovation; Industrial revolutions; Innovative technology; Investment strategy; Long-term sustainability; Portfolio optimization; State of the art; Technological advancement; financial market; industrialization; innovation; investment; optimization; stock market; technological development; Cryptocurrency","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (15CGJ021)","National Social Science Foundation (15CGJ021) “Building of Silk Road Economic Belt and Promoting the RMB to Become a Globe Reserve currency.”","Ahluwalia S., Mahto R.V., Guerrero M., Blockchain technology and startup financing: a transaction cost economics perspective, Technol.

However, while promoting economic development, the lack of regulatory measures and the imperfect credit system have severely restricted the further development of the sharing economy. Blockchain technology (BT), as a new distributed infrastructure and computing method, has always been the core technology of Bitcoin. Based on the development of generalized economic model and BT, this paper analyzes the shortcomings of generalized economic model and blockchain technology through information fusion big data and proposes a kind of information based on information fusion big data+public BT. The security management system adapts to the status quo of the sharing economy and uses the functions of information fusion big data+blockchain technology to solve the current information security risks faced by the sharing economy. The experimental results of this article show that the sharing economy information security management system based on information fusion big data+blockchain technology has good protection capabilities. The interception rate of external information reached 95%, and the interception rate of system information reached 93%. Better protection of privacy leaks is needed.  © 2021 Jian Xiao.","","Blockchain; Economic and social effects; Economics; Information fusion; Information management; Security of data; 'current; Block-chain; Credit system; Economic development; Economic models; Further development; Information security managements; Security management systems; Third party payments; Utilization rates; Big data","","","","","","","Namasudra S., Roy P., PpBAC, Journal of Organizational and End User Computing, 30, 4, pp. 14-31, (2018); Lv Z., Singh A.K., Li J., Deep learning for security problems in 5G heterogeneous networks, IEEE Network, 35, 2, pp. 67-73, (2021); Li X., Liu H., Wang W., Zheng Y., Lv H., Lv Z., Big data analysis of the internet of things in the digital twins of smart city based on deep learning, Future Generation Computer Systems, 128, pp. 167-177, (2021); Lv Z., Lou R., Li J., Singh A.K., Song H., Big data analytics for 6G-enabled massive internet of things, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 7, pp. 5350-5359, (2021); Zaharia M., Xin R.S., Wendell P., Das T., Armbrust M., Dave A., Meng X., Rosen J., Venkataraman S., Franklin M.J., Ghodsi A., Apache Spark: A unified engine for big data processing, Communications of the ACM, 59, 11, pp. 56-65, (2016); Ibrahim A., Yahaya J.H., Information security factors in the implementation of industrial control system into cloud environment, Advanced Science Letters, 24, 7, pp. 5239-5242, (2018); Lee J.A., Tripartite perspective on the copyright-sharing economy in China, Computer Law & Security Review, 35, 4, pp. 434-452, (2019); Bharathi S.V., Prioritizing and ranking the big data information security risk spectrum, Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, 18, 3, pp. 183-201, (2017); Xu L., Jiang C., Wang J., Yuan J., Ren Y., Information security in big data: Privacy and data mining, IEEE Access, 2, 2, pp. 1149-1176, (2017); Obermeyer Z., Emanuel E.J., Predicting the future-big data, machine learning, and clinical medicine, The New England Journal of Medicine, 375, 13, pp. 1216-1219, (2016); Athey S., Beyond prediction: Using big data for policy problems, Science, 355, 6324, pp. 483-485, (2017); Da Q., Sun J., Zhang L., Kou L., Wang W., Han Q., Zhou R., A novel hybrid information security scheme for 2D vector map, Mobile Networks and Applications, 23, 4, pp. 734-742, (2018); Zou D., Xu Z., Information security risks outside the laser beam in terrestrial free-space optical communication, IEEE Photonics Journal, 8, 5, pp. 1-9, (2016); Edelman B., Luca M., Svirsky D., Racial discrimination in the sharing economy: Evidence from a field experiment, Applied Economics, 9, 2, pp. 1-22, (2017); Narasimhan C., Papatla P., Jiang B., Kopalle P.K., Messinger P.R., Moorthy S., Proserpio D., Subramanian U., Wu C., Zhu T., Sharing economy: Review of current research and future directions, Customer Needs and Solutions, 5, 1-2, pp. 93-106, (2018); Chen M., Ma Y., Song J., Lai C.F., Hu B., Smart clothing: Connecting human with clouds and big data for sustainable health monitoring, Mobile Networks & Applications, 21, 5, pp. 825-845, (2016); Hashem I., Chang V., Anuar N.B., Adewole K., Yaqoob I., Gani A., Ahmed E., Chiroma H., The role of big data in smart city, International Journal of Information Management, 36, 5, pp. 748-758, (2016); Zhou K., Fu C., Yang S., Big data driven smart energy management: From big data to big insights, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews, 56, pp. 215-225, (2016); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Big data analytics in E-commerce: A systematic review and agenda for future research, Electronic Markets, 26, 2, pp. 173-194, (2016); Zhang Y., Qiu M., Tsai C.W., Hassan M.M., Alamri A., Health-CPS: Healthcare cyber-physical system assisted by cloud and big data, IEEE Systems Journal, 11, 1, pp. 88-95, (2017); Vithanwattana N., Mapp G., George C., Developing a comprehensive information security framework for mHealth: A detailed analysis, Journal of Reliable Intelligent Environments, 3, 1, pp. 21-39, (2017); Mauro A.D., Greco M., Grimaldi M., A formal definition of big data based on its essential features, Library Review, 65, 3, pp. 122-135, (2016); Chen G., Lu Y., Meng Y., Li B., Tan K., Pei D., Cheng P., Luo L., Xiong Y., Wang X., Zhao Y., Fuso: Fast multi-path loss recovery for data center networks, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 26, 3, pp. 1376-1389, (2018); Lv Z., Song H., Trust mechanism of feedback trust weight in multimedia network, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications, 17, 4, pp. 1-26, (2021)","J.

However, due to economies of scale, industrial synergies, efficiency gains, and system design, activities at different scales will perform differently in terms of life cycle impact – in a non-linear way. This study addresses the issue of using the linear framework of LCA to study scalable and emerging technologies, by looking at different examples where technology scale up reflects non-linearly on the impact of a product. First, a computer simulation applied to an entire database is used to quantitatively estimate the effect of assuming activities in a product system are subject to improvements in efficiency. This provides a theoretical but indicative idea of how much uncertainty can be introduced by non-linear relationships between input values and results at the database level. Then the non-linear relations between the environmental burden per tkm of transport on one end, and the cargo mass and range autonomy on the other end is highlighted using a parametrized LCA model for heavy goods vehicles combined with learning scenarios that reflect different load factors and improvement in battery technology. Finally, a last example explores the case of activities related to the mining of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, an emerging technology, and how the impact of scaling the Bitcoin mining production is affected non-linearly by factors such as increase in mining efficiency and geographical distribution of miners. The paper concludes by discussing the relation between non-linearity and uncertainty and by providing recommendations for accounting for non-linearity in prospective LCA studies.

Thereafter, all the major oil markets have become extremely volatile, and investments in these markets could lead to substantial losses. This paper empirically investigates the time-varying correlations between gold and oil markets to examine whether gold is a safe haven asset for the international crude oil markets during the COVID-19 period. For the purpose of comparison, the safe haven property of Bitcoin is tested as well. The results of the time-varying correlations obtained through the DCC-GARCH model suggest that gold is a safe haven asset for global crude oil markets. Bitcoin, on the other hand, acts only as a diversifier for crude oil. The results further show that the portfolio risk is minimized when investors include oil and gold in their portfolio rather than holding assets in oil and Bitcoin markets. Given that financial downturn, terrorist attacks, pandemics and similar global events often play a crucial role in portfolio risk analysis, our results could be of interest to those who invest in oil, gold and Bitcoin markets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; COVID-19; Crude oil; Gold; Safe haven","Coronavirus; Bitcoin; Crude oil; Gold; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Coronaviruses; Crude oil market; DCC-GARCH models; International crude oil markets; Oil market; Portfolio risks; Terrorist attacks; Time varying; correlation; COVID-19; crude oil; disease incidence; economic impact; oil trade; resource economy; respiratory disease; risk assessment; viral disease; Investments","","","","","","","Agyei-Ampomah S., Gounopoulos D., Mazouz K., Does gold offer a better protection against losses in sovereign debt bonds than other metals?, J.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate bitcoin literature based on the structures and networks of science, as a first step in the research of this new phenomenon. Analysing the growing scientific literature on bitcoin published between 2012 and 2019, we provided useful insights on academic research in this field regarding publication year, type and category, authors, journals and citations. The source of the 887 documents which support the study was Web of Science Core Collection. Using VOSviewer software we have designed bibliometric maps based on text and bibliographic data. Our study provides a knowledge area map that identifies and evaluates the links between authors and countries distribution, the conceptual structure of the field, the structure and connections of most cited papers and journals. Resuming our findings, we note a concentration of the interest on some keywords (bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain) and on some influential authors (with more than 100 citations per article). As a pure expression of digital economy, the research on bitcoin as an economic concept counts only 33.5% from the total contributions in the field. © 2019 tean Ramona et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","Bibliometric study; Bitcoin; Knowledge area map; Scientific literature; Vosviewer","","","","","","","","Alvarez-Ramirez J., Rodriguez E., Ibarra-Valdez C., Long-range correlations and asymmetry in the Bitcoin market, Physica A-Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 492, pp. 948-955, (2018); Aria M., Cuccurullo C., Bibliometrix: An R-Tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis, Journal of Informetrics, 11, 4, pp. 959-975, (2017); Balcilar M., Bouri E., Gupta R., Roubaud D., Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility?

The functionality of the cryptocurrency highly depends upon the use of advanced technology and resulted in the emergence of a number of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, etc. The evolution and growth of cryptocurrency have been tremendous during the last 10 years and has revolutionised the whole financial sector. The cryptocurrency provides immense opportunities to the users in the form of increased job propensities and new market ventures along with certain challenges like volatility, lack of markets and so on. The risk and return factors involved with the usability and adaptability of cryptocurrency has also impacted the users in both positive and negative ways.

This is because both the institutional and retail investors’ interests in the Bitcoin market are growing rapidly. Conversely, the seemingly unregulated nature of this market is a serious concern to most economies and results to the placement of ban on Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in some economies by the government. Daily series of return and volume within the window of the ICO ban in China was used for the Bitcoin market and S&P500 stock market to examine the effect of a government risk in the Bitcoin market and possible hedging capabilities. Empirical results show that the ban dampened Bitcoin returns and the returns from each market can predict the other. The Exogenous Dynamic Conditional Correlation (Exo-DCC) model result suggests that, yes! the S&P500 stocks are capable of hedging Bitcoin risk, while Bitcoin can also hedge S&P500 stocks’ risks and vice versa. The Exogenous BEKK (Exo-BEKK) model result shows evidence of bidirectional volatility spill over between the two markets studied. In practice, investors (institutions and retailers) can comfortably form a robust investment portfolio with (at least) these two assets and develop a hedging strategy, such that the impacts of risks on the portfolio’s returns are safely hedged. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. corrected publication 2019.","Bitcoin; D81; G12; G32; Hedging; R53; Return; Risk management; Stock; Volatility","","","","","","","","Ashley R.A., Patterson D.M., A test of the GARCH(1, 1) specification for daily stock returns, Macroeconomic Dynamics, 14, pp. 137-144, (2010); Baba Y., Engle R.F., Kroner K.F., Multivariate simultaneous generalized arch, Econometric Theory, 11, 1, pp. 122-150, (1995); Baur D.G., Lucey B.M., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a Bayesian asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (BADCC-MGARCH) model with skewness and heavy tails on daily sample ranging from August 11, 2015, to February 10, 2020, to investigate the dynamic correlation between price return of several cryptocurrencies and stock return of the technology companies' indices that mainly operate on the blockchain platform. Data are collected from multiple sources. For parameter estimation and model comparison, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is employed. Besides, based on the expected Akaike information criterion (EAIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance information criterion (DIC) and weighted Deviance Information Criterion (wDIC), the skewed-multivariate Generalized Error Distribution (mvGED) is selected as an optimal distribution for errors. Finally, some other tests are carried out to check the robustness of the results. Findings: The study results indicate that blockchain-based technology companies' indices' return and price return of cryptocurrencies are positively correlated for most of the sampling period. Besides, the return price of newly invented and more advanced cryptocurrencies with unique characteristics, including Monero, Ripple, Dash, Stellar and Peercoin, positively correlates with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more than 93% of sampling days. The results are also robust to various sensitivity analyses. Research limitations/implications: The positive correlation between the price return of cryptocurrencies and the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies can be due to the investors' sentiments toward blockchain technology as both cryptocurrencies and these companies are based on blockchain technology. It could also be due to the applicability of cryptocurrencies for these companies, as the price return of more advanced and capable cryptocurrencies with unique features has a positive correlation with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more days compared to the other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, that may be regarded more as speculative assets. Practical implications: The study results may show the positive role of cryptocurrencies in improving and developing technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services and vice versa, suggesting that managers and regulators should pay more attention to the usefulness of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. This study also has important risk management and diversification implications for investors and companies investing in cryptocurrencies and these companies' stock. Besides, blockchain-based technology companies can add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio as hedgers or diversifiers based on their strategy. Originality/value: This is the first study analyzing the connection between leading cryptocurrencies and technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services by employing the Bayesian ssymmetric DCC-MGARCH model. The results also have important implications for investors, companies, regulators and researchers for future studies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bayesian asymmetric DCC-MGARCH; Cryptocurrencies; Emerging digital economy companies; Markov chain Monte Carlo","","","","","","","","Agbo C.C., Mahmoud Q.H., Eklund J.M., Blockchain technology in healthcare: a systematic review, Paper Presented at the Healthcare, (2019); Albrecht S., Reichert S., Schmid J., Struker J., Neumann D., Fridgen G., Dynamics of blockchain implementation-a case study from the energy sector, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, (2018); Ali R., Barrdear J., Clews R., Southgate J., The Economics of Digital Currencies, (2014); Allen B., Bryant S.K., The market for cryptocurrency: how will it evolve?, Global Economy Journal, 19, 3, (2019); Andoni M., Robu V., Flynn D., Abram S., Geach D., Jenkins D., McCallum P., Peacock A., Blockchain technology in the energy sector: a systematic review of challenges and opportunities, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 100, pp. 143-174, (2019); Araz O.M., Choi T.M., Olson D.L., Salman F.S., Role of analytics for operational risk management in the era of big data, Decision Sciences, 51, 6, pp. 1320-1346, (2020); Ardia D., Bluteau K., Ruede M., Regime changes in Bitcoin GARCH volatility dynamics, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 266-271, (2019); Azzi R., Chamoun R.K., Sokhn M., The power of a blockchain-based supply chain, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 135, pp. 582-592, (2019); Ba S., Zhu H., Margin trading, short selling, investor sentiment and stock market volatility, Studies of International Finance, 32, pp. 82-96, (2016); Baek C., Elbeck M., Bitcoins as an investment or speculative vehicle?

The first solution M-PESA launched in Kenya in 2007 is one of the world’s major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MNOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently, in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs (CFA franc, officially African Financial Community franc) per day. The Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) is the heart technology of mobile money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The rate of unbanked is so high in developing countries that it does not favor economy development. According to the World Bank, mobile money contributes to skip this obstacle. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art of mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries in general, and in Burkina-Faso particularly. We propose a mobile money solution based on the blockchain, in order to increase security, trust, and move towards a federation of mobile money platforms. © 2021, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Mobile Money; Payments; Security; Traceability; Trust; USSD","Cryptocurrency; Developing countries; Financial community; Mobile network operators; Money transactions; Money transfers; State of the art; Sub-Saharan countries; Subscriber identity module; Supplementary services; Blockchain","","","","","","","3Rd Cyber Security in Networking Conference (Csnet), pp. 14-20, (2019); Redaction L.; Nguyen Q.K., Blockchain - a financial technology for future sustainable development, 2016 3Rd International Conference on Green Technology and Sustainable Development (GTSD), pp. 51-54, (2016); Popova N.A., Butakova N.G., Research of a possibility of using blockchain technology without tokens to protect banking transactions, 2019 IEEE Conference of Russian Young Researchers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Eiconrus), pp. 1764-1768, (2019); Hanifatunnisa R., Rahardjo B., Blockchain based e-voting recording system design, 2017 11Th International Conference on Telecommunication Systems Services and Applications (TSSA), pp. 1-6, (2017); Thuy L.-C., Cao-Minh K., Dang-Le-bao C., Nguyen T.A., Votereum: An Ethereum-based e-voting system, 2019 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies (RIVF), pp. 1-6, (2019); Liu Q., Guan Q., Yang X., Zhu H., Green G., Yin S., Education-industry cooperative system based on blockchain, 2018 1St IEEE International Conference on Hot Information-Centric Networking (Hoticn), pp. 207-211, (2018); Nath I., Data exchange platform to fight insurance fraud on blockchain, 2016 IEEE 16Th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), pp. 821-825, (2016); Wu H.-T., Tsai C.-W., An intelligent agriculture network security system based on private blockchains, Journal of Communications and Networks, 21, 5, pp. 503-508, (2019); He X., Alqahtani S., Gamble R., Toward privacy-assured health insurance claims, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (Ithings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (Greencom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (Cpscom) and IEEE Smart Data (Smartdata), pp. 1634-1641, (2018); Mugambi A., Njunge C., Yang S.C., Mobile-money benefits and usage: the case of M-PESA, IT Professional, 16, 3, pp. 16-21, (2014); Thiga M., A model for the delivery of SMS and USSD location-based mobile advertising using network-based positioning, 2016 IST-Africa Week Conference, pp. 1-10, (2016); Leopoldie M., Qu’est-ce Que l’USSD Et Pourquoi Est-Ce Un Moteur De développement économique En Afrique ?

Blockchain technology and blockchain cryptocurrencies are the best means to confront this new trustless economy. Millions of smart devices are able to complete transparent financial transactions via blockchain technology and its related cryptocurrencies. However, via blockchain technology, internet‐connected devices may be hacked to mine cryptocurrencies. In this regard, monitoring the network of these blockchain‐based transactions can be very useful to detect the abnormal behavior of users of these cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the transactions can be assured. In this paper, a novel procedure is proposed to monitor the network of blockchain cryptocurrency transactions. To do so, a hidden Markov multi‐linear tensor model (HMTM) is utilized to model the transactions among nodes of the blockchain network. Then, a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control chart is applied to the monitoring of the latent effects. Average run length (ARL) is used to evaluate the performance of the MEWMA control chart in detecting blockchain network anomalies. The proposed procedure is applied to a real dataset of Bitcoin transactions. © 2020 by the authors.

This open nature of the transactional ledger allows us to gain macroeconomic insight into the USD 1 Trillion crypto economy. In this paper, we explore the free market-based economy of eight major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, ZCash, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic. We specifically focus on the aspect of wealth distribution within these cryptocurrencies as understanding wealth concentration allows us to highlight potential information security implications associated with wealth concentration. We also draw a parallel between the crypto economies and real-world economies. To adequately address these two points, we devise a generic econometric analysis schema for cryptocurrencies. Through this schema, we report on two primary econometric measures: Gini value and Nakamoto Index which report on wealth inequality and 51% wealth concentration respectively. Our analysis reports that, despite the heavy emphasis on decentralization in cryptocurrencies, the wealth distribution remains in-line with the real-world economies, with the exception of Dash. We also report that 3 of the observed cryptocurrencies (Dogecoin, ZCash, and Ethereum Classic) violate the honest majority assumption with less than 100 participants controlling over 51% wealth in the ecosystem, potentially indicating a security threat. This suggests that the free-market fundamentalism doctrine may be inadequate in countering wealth inequality within a crypto-economic context: Algorithmically driven free-market implementation of these cryptocurrencies may eventually lead to wealth inequality similar to those observed in real-world economies.

ICOs help projects to be funded in a short time with a high-profit margin. The primary purpose of this study is isolating the principal factors that affect the decision to invest in an ICO. A large array of potential signals, consisting of promotion and marketing effects, investor motivation, founder team effects, whitepaper and ICO specific factors, are considered in an online survey and the responses are analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The results of the analysis reveal five composite principal factors that determine the decision to invest in an ICO. These five principal factors are the ICO whitepaper, websites for finance news and ICO listings, ICO project sector and founder, ICO project team and social media. Our findings provide a perspective to both investor and ICO founders about which factors to prioritize when deciding to launch an ICO or to invest in one. © 2020 Sciedu Press.","Cryptocurrency; Digital currency; Exploratory factor analysis; ICO; Initial coin offering","","","","","","","","Amsden R., Schweizer D., Are Blockchain Crowdsales the New 'Gold Rush'?, Success Determinants of Initial Coin Offerings, (2018); Barsan I.M., Legal Challenges of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Financier (RTDF), 3, pp. 54-65, (2017); Bartlett M.S., Tests of Significance In Factor Analysis, British Journal Of Statistical Psychology, 3, pp. 77-85, (1950); Boreiko D., Sahdev N.K., To ICO or not to ICO-Empirical analysis of Initial Coin Offerings and Token Sales, SSRNElectronic Journal, (2018); Chuen D.L.K., Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data, (2015); de Jong A., Roosenboom P., van der Kolk T., What Determines Success in Initial Coin Offerings?, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2018); Fisch C., Initial coin offerings (ICOs) to finance new ventures, Journal of Business Venturing, 34, pp. 1-22, (2019); Howell S.T., Niessner M., Yermack D., Initial Coin Offerings: Financing Growth with Cryptocurrency Token Sales, The Review of Financial Studies, (2019); Jaffe J., Initial Coin Offerings, Explained, CNET, (2018); Li T., Shin D., Wang B., Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump Schemes, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2019); Lisk, Whitepapers Explained; Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Ozturkoglu O., Saygili E.E., Ozturkoglu Y., A manufacturing-oriented model for evaluating the satisfaction of workers-Evidence from Turkey, International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, (2016); Sockin M., Xiong W., A model of cryptocurrencies, (2018); Tabachnick B.G., Fidell L.S., Using Multivariate Statistics Title: Using multivariate statistics, (2019); Willett J., MasterCoin Complete Specification vs. 1.0 (First Complete Specification), (2012); Woods S., #Sponsored: The Emergence of Influencer Marketing, (2016); Zetzsche D.A., Buckley R.P., Arner D.W., Fohr L., The ICO Gold Rush: It's a Scam, It's a Bubble, It's a Super Challenge for Regulators, SSRNElectronic Journal, (2017)","A.O.

At the same time, national jurisdictions no longer have the opportunity to ignore the fact of business working with crypto assets. Meanwhile, without consensus in the consistent resolution of financial, tax, and other cross-country relations, operations with crypto assets can belong to the underground economy sphere to a large extent. In this regard, the issues of regulating macroeconomic factors when reflecting crypto assets in the structure of the current classification, the procedure for their fair valuation, taking into account the formation of classification and content construction in the financial statements of companies, are relevant. Another aspect is to conduct comprehensive analysis in order to consider scientific and practical approaches to the procedure of classification and evaluation of cryptographic assets in scientific research, professional judgments of major audit international organizations. In this regard, the study focuses on a practical analysis of the current accounting policies of companies operating with crypto assets, taking into account the position of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC). Based on the results of the conducted research, the existing models of classification and evaluation of crypto assets are assessed, and the most problematic practical aspects of their application are highlighted. This made it possible to propose promising models for managing the value of crypto assets, containing the existing practices currently used by companies and their possible directions. It was concluded that the most promising way out of the conflict of interests of business and the current rules of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to refine the existing standards, introduce rules of classification and evaluation of crypto assets. The authors also do not exclude that the best solution is to develop a new IFRS standard for the accounting of crypto assets. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Bitcoin; Cash and cash equivalents; Crypto assets; Economics; Financial instruments; IFRS; Intangible assets; Inventory; Recognition and measurement; Valuation models","","","","","","","","Adhami S., Giudici G., Martinazzi S., Why do businesses go crypto?

Empirical investigations are executed through symmetric, asymmetric and non‐linear causality tests, and Markov regime‐switching regression (MRSR) analysis. Results show that Bitcoin has a causal nexus with Chinese yuan and Indian rupee for price and various return components. The MRSR analysis justifies these findings by demonstrating the presence of interaction in contractionary regimes. Accordingly, it can be stated that when markets display a downward trend, appreciation of the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee positively and strongly affects the value of Bitcoin, possibly due to the market timing. The MRSR analysis also exhibits a transition from a tranquil to a crisis regime in March 2020 because of the pandemic. However, a shorter duration spent in the crisis regime in 2020 indicates the limited and relatively less harmful effect of the pandemic on the cryptocurrency market when compared to the turmoil that occurred in 2018. © 2020 by the authors.

To achieve this aim, we propose an extended Vector Autoregressive model, aimed at explaining the evolution of trading volumes, both in time and in space. The extension is based on network models, which improve pure autoregressive models, introducing a contemporaneous contagion component that describes contagion effects between trading volumes. Our empirical findings show that transactions activities in bitcoins is dominated by groups of network participants in Europe and in the United States, consistent with the expectation that market interactions primarily take place in developed economies. © 2020 by the authors.

This article is an attempt to reveal the effects of policy uncertainty on Bitcoin returns with economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in the US, the UK, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, we also present the results of monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) on the Bitcoin market. The robust estimations from the quantile regression and Markov regime-switching model show that Bitcoin returns are affected by EPU. One of the essential findings is that Bitcoin returns are more responsive to EPU in the US, China, and Japan. In the US and Japan, uncertainty has a negative effect on the Bitcoin market whereas in China it has a positive effect. Global MPU uncertainty is also significant in explaining Bitcoin exchange rates. Moreover, the Bitcoin market is negatively affected by uncertainty in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the gross domestic product, and other macroeconomic data. Uncertainty in the equity market and Bitcoin returns are negatively associated. © 2020 The Author","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Economic policy uncertainty; FOMC","","","","","","","","Alvarez-Ramirez J., Rodriguez E., Ibarra-Valdez C., Long-range correlations and asymmetry in the Bitcoin market, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 492, pp. 948-955, (2018); Arbaa O., Varon E., Turkish currency crisis–Spillover effects on European banks, Borsa Istanbul Review, 19, 4, pp. 372-378, (2019); Baek C., Elbeck M., Bitcoins as an investment or speculative vehicle?

This paper presents an analysis of the Bitcoin users graph, obtained by clustering the transaction graph, to highlight its connectivity structure and the economical meaning of the different obtained components. In fact, the bow tie structure, already observed for the graph of the web, is augmented, in the Bitocoin users graph, with the economical information about the entities involved. We study the connectivity components of the users graph individually, to infer their macroscopic contribution to the whole economy.

Consequently, it would be attractive for designers and policy-makers in this area to make out what social media users think about them on Twitter. The purpose of this study is to investigate the social opinions about different kinds of crypto-currencies and tune the best-customized classification technique to categorize the tweets based on sentiments. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilized a lexicon-based approach for analyzing the reviews on a wide range of crypto-currencies over Twitter data to measure positive, negative or neutral sentiments; in addition, the end result of sentiments played a training role to train a supervised technique, which can predict the sentiment loading of tweets about the main crypto-currencies. Findings: The findings further prove that more than 50 per cent of people have positive beliefs about crypto-currencies. Furthermore, this paper confirms that marketers can predict the sentiment of tweets about these crypto-currencies with high accuracy if they use appropriate classification techniques like support vector machine (SVM). Practical implications: Considering the growing interest in crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, Litcoin and Ripple), the findings of this paper have a remarkable value for enterprises in the financial area to obtain the promised benefits of social media analysis at work. In addition, this paper helps crypto-currencies vendors analyze public opinion in social media platforms. In this sense, the current paper strengthens our understanding of what happens in social media for crypto-currencies. Originality/value: For managers and decision-makers, this paper suggests that the news and campaign for their crypto in Twitter would affect people’s perspectives in a good manner. Because of this fact, the firms, investing in these crypto-currencies, could apply the social media as a magnifier for their promotional activities. The findings steer the market managers to see social media as a predictor tool, which can analyze the market through understanding the opinions of users of Twitter. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Crypto-currencies; Sentiment analysis; Twitter","","","","","","","","Ahmed S., Jaidka K., Cho J., The 2014 Indian elections on twitter: a comparison of campaign strategies of political parties, Telematics and Informatics, 33, 4, pp. 1071-1087, (2016); Angel J.J., McCabe D., The ethics of payments: paper, plastic, or Bitcoin?, Journal of Business Ethics, 132, 3, pp. 603-611, (2015); Asur S., Huberman B.A., Predicting the future with social media, Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology-Volume 01, (2010); Aue A., Gamon M., Customizing sentiment classifiers to new domains: a case study, Paper presented at the Proceedings of recent advances in natural language processing (RANLP), (2005); Bhattacharya S., Yang C., Srinivasan P., Boynton B., Perceptions of presidential candidates' personalities in twitter, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67, 2, pp. 249-267, (2016); Blau B.M., Price dynamics and speculative trading in bitcoin, Research in International Business and Finance, 43, pp. 15-21, (2018); Bose S., Saha U., Kar D., Goswami S., Nayak K.A., Chakrabarti S., RSentiment: a tool to extract meaningful insights from textual reviews, Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Frontiers in Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications, (2017); Capriello A., Mason P.R., Davis B., Crotts J.C., Farm tourism experiences in travel reviews: a cross-comparison of three alternative methods for data analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 6, pp. 778-785, (2013); Chiu C., Chiu N.H., Sung R.J., Hsieh P.Y., Opinion mining of hotel customer-generated contents in Chinese weblogs, Current Issues in Tourism, 18, 5, pp. 477-495, (2015); ColianniRosales S., Signorotti M., Algorithmic trading of cryptocurrency based on twitter sentiment analysis, (2015); Daniel M., Neves R.F., Horta N., Company event popularity for financial markets using twitter and sentiment analysis, Expert Systems with Applications, 71, pp. 111-124, (2017); Danneman N., Heimann R., Social Media Mining with R, (2014); DessaiKamat K.G., Wagh R., Application of social media for tracking knowledge in agile software projects, (2012); Dodds P.S., Harris K.D., Kloumann I.M., Bliss C.A., Danforth C.M., Temporal patterns of happiness and information in a global social network: Hedonometrics and twitter, PloS One, 6, 12, (2011); Ferguson N., The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World, (2008); Fernandez-Gavilanes M., Alvarez-Lopez T., Juncal-Martinez J., Costa-Montenegro E., Gonzalez-Castano F.J., Unsupervised method for sentiment analysis in online texts, Expert Systems with Applications, 58, pp. 57-75, (2016); Fry J., Cheah E.T., Negative bubbles and shocks in cryptocurrency markets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 47, pp. 343-352, (2016); GoBhayani A., Huang L., Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision, (2009); Grinberg R., Bitcoin: an innovative alternative digital currency, Hastings Sci. and Tech.

In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing. © 2020","Bitcoin; Brent; COVID-19 Pandemic; Gas; Gold; Mutual information; Renyi entropy; S&P500; Silver; VIX; WTI","Bitcoin; Gold; Information analysis; Investments; Silver; Energy markets; Gold and silver; Information levels; Information sharing; Information sharing network; Market expectations; Multi-scale entropies; Mutual informations; Information dissemination","","","","","","","Ashraf B.N., Stock markets’ reaction to COVID-19: Cases or fatalities?, Res Int Bus Finance, 54, (2020); Sharif A., Aloui C., Yarovaya L., COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices, stock market, geopolitical risk and policy uncertainty nexus in the US economy: Fresh evidence from the wavelet-based approach, Int Rev Financ Anal, 70, (2020); Al-Awadhi A.M., Alsaifi K., Al-Awadhi A., Alhammadi S., Death and contagious infectious diseases: impact of the COVID-19 virus on stock market returns, J Behav Exp Finance, 27, (2020); Zhang D., Hu M., Ji Q., Financial markets under the global pandemic of COVID-19, Finance Res Lett, (2020); Okorie D.I., Lin B., Stock markets and the COVID-19 fractal contagion effects, Finance Res Lett, (2020); Wang J., Shao W., Kim J., Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the correlations between crude oil and agricultural futures, Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 136, (2020); Lahmiri S., Bekiros S., The impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon stability and sequential irregularity of equity and cryptocurrency markets, Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 138, (2020); Renyi A., On measures of information and entropy, Proceedings of the 4th Berkeley symposium on mathematics, statistics and probability, pp. 547-561, (1960); Moon Y.I., Rajagopalan B., Lall U., Estimation of mutual information using kernel density estimators, Phys Rev E, 52, pp. 2318-2321, (1995); Lahmiri S., Bekiros S., Nonlinear analysis of Casablanca stock exchange, Dow Jones and S&P500 industrial sectors with a comparison, Physica A, 5391, (2020); Lahmiri S., Bekiros S., Avdoulas C., Time-dependent complexity measurement of causality in international equity markets: a spatial approach, Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 116, pp. 215-219, (2018); Argyroudis G.S., Siokis F.M., Spillover effects of Great recession on Hong-Kong's real estate market: an analysis based on causality plane and Tsallis curves of complexity-entropy, Physica A, 524, pp. 576-586, (2019); Zhou Q., Shang P., Weighted multiscale cumulative residual Rényi permutation entropy of financial time series, Physica A, 540, (2020); Ishizaki R., Inoue M., Analysis of local and global instability in foreign exchange rates using short-term information entropy, Physica A, 555, (2020); Lahmiri S., Bekiros S., Chaos, randomness and multi-fractality in Bitcoin market, Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 106, pp. 28-34, (2018); Lahmiri S., Bekiros S., Disturbances and complexity in volatility time series, Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 105, pp. 38-42, (2017); Zhao X., Zhang P., Multiscale horizontal visibility entropy: measuring the temporal complexity of financial time series, Physica A, 537, (2020); Lahmiri S., Uddin G.S., Bekiros S., Nonlinear dynamics of equity, currency and commodity markets in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Chaos, Solitons Fractals, 103, pp. 342-346, (2017); Karaca Y., Zhang Y.-D., Muhammad K., Characterizing complexity and self-similarity based on fractal and entropy analyses for stock market forecast modelling, Expert Syst Appl, 144, (2020); Wang P., Zong L., Ma Y., An integrated early warning system for stock market turbulence, Expert Syst Appl, 153, (2020); Aksarayli M., Pala O., A polynomial goal programming model for portfolio optimization based on entropy and higher moments, Expert Syst Appl, 94, pp. 185-192, (2018); Tang H., Shi Y., Dong P., Public blockchain evaluation using entropy and TOPSIS, Expert Syst Appl, 117, pp. 204-210, (2019); Cheng C.-H., Wei L.-Y., Data spread-based entropy clustering method using adaptive learning, Expert Syst Appl, 36, pp. 12357-12361, (2009); Zmeskal O., Dzik P., Vesely M., Entropy of fractal systems, Comput Math Appl, 66, pp. 135-146, (2013); Principe J.C., Information Theoretic Learning: Renyi's Entropy and Kernel Perspectives, (2010)","S.

It has long been a pivot point of attention for investors who are in pursuit of a safe haven asset. In this paper, we use the wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile method, and the quantile-based Granger causality method, in order to investigate the notion of Bitcoin in actually being a safe-haven asset, amid political and economic uncertainty in the US for the period between 2010:M06, and 2020:M10. Using the Partisan Conflict Index (PCI), and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) as proxies of uncertainties, we find that although Bitcoin effectively appears to be a safe haven asset when uncertainties are on the rise, however, this relationship tends to change during the short- to long-run. In this regard, our sample provides us with a unique opportunity to evaluate the safe haven hypothesis for Bitcoin, amid a time span with three Presidential elections in the US, and recently, an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, which has been declared as a global pandemic. We have also supplemented our analysis with the bootstrap rolling window causality method, as a measure of robustness. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic economic situation, our work provides valuable knowledge for investors, who wish to construct investment portfolios based on Bitcoin, and also provide insights for regulators about how to regulate the cryptocurrency speculation in an effective manner. © 2021","Bitcoin; Covid-19; Economic policy uncertainty; Partisan conflict; Quantile-On-Quantile; US","United States; Investments; Economic policies; Economic situation; Economic uncertainty; Financial products; Granger Causality; Industrial revolutions; Investment portfolio; Presidential election; COVID-19; disease incidence; economic policy; electronic commerce; financial system; Granger causality test; investment; party politics; political economy; uncertainty analysis; Bitcoin","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20BJY021)","This research is partly supported by the National Social Science Fund of China ( 20BJY021 ).

Cryptocurrencies analyzed include the Bitcoins, Ethereum, Litecoin, Steller, Bitcoin Cash, and USD Tether. The results suggest that, on average, correlation between digital assets in the cryptocurrencies’ ecosystem is positive. However, there is evidence of an outlier with respect to the USD Tether (USDT) in the global market, revealing that the USDT is negatively associated with all other cryptocurrencies. This is supported by the dynamic regression results that provided evidence of reinforcement effect in favor of the USDT in the global crypto market, thus confirming the status of the USDT as “Stablecoin” as it is pegged 1:1 to USD. In the global market context, the results also revealed that USDT/USD returns had identical outliers that could portend lesser chances of extreme gains or losses compared with suggestions of extreme gains or losses in the EMEs. Furthermore, USDT did not seem to have similar evolution in the EMEs where it had relatively marginal influence in the markets. The vector error correction (VEC) estimate showed mixed results between Altcoins in all the markets; moreover, our finding showed that reinforcement effects hold in favor of Steller (XLM) both in the Russian ruble and Indian rupee crypto markets, whereas the Chinese yuan crypto market was predominantly characterized by substitution effect in favor of Bitcoin. © The Author(s) 2021.","Altcoins; Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; emerging market economies; reinforcement effect; substitution effect","","","","","","","","Alfonso A.D., Langer P., Vandelis Z., The future of cryptocurrency: An investor’s comparison of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Compiled for the 2016 Economist, pp. 1-25, (2016); Aloosh A., The price of a digital currency, (2017); Aslanidis N., Bariviera A.F., Martinez-Ibanez O., An analysis of cryptocurrencies conditional cross correlations, (2018); Aste T., Cryptocurrency market structure: Connecting emotions and economics, Digital Finance, 1, pp. 5-21, (2019); Bacao P., Duarte A.P., Sebastiao H., Redzepagic S., Information transmission between cryptocurrencies: Does Bitcoin rule the cryptocurrency world?, (2018); Badev A., Chen M., Bitcoin: Technical background and data analysis, (2014); Baumann J., Lesoismier A., The new era of crypto wealth management, SwissBorg, pp. 1-27, (2018); Brosens T., Cocuzzo C., Riding the cryptocoaster—Decoding the Black box: Can this money be trusted?, (2017); Bullard J., Exchange rate volatility and cryptocurrencies, (2018); Burnie A., Exploring the interconnectedness of cryptocurrencies using correlation networks, (2018); Chan S., Chu J., Nadarajah S., Osterrieder J., A statistical analysis of cryptocurrencies, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 10, 2, (2017); Chu J., Chan S., Nadarajah S., Osterrieder J., GARCH modelling of cryptocurrencies, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 10, 4, (2017); Dyhrberg A.H., Bitcoin, gold and the dollar—A GARCH volatility analysis, (2015); Virtual currency schemes—A further analysis, (2015); Ferreira P., Pereira E., Contagion effect in cryptocurrency market, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 12, 3, (2019); Frances C.J., Grau-Carles P., Arellano D.J., The cryptocurrency market: A network analysis, Esic Market Economics and Business Journal, 49, 3, pp. 569-583, (2018); Gandal N., Halaburda H., Competition in the cryptocurrency market, (2014); Gandal N., Halaburda H., Can we predict the winner in a market with network effects?

However, the transparency and traceability of blockchain severely restrict the anonymity of participants in the real world, which will cause participants' privacy leakage. Toward this end, in this paper, an anonymous off-blockchain micropayments scheme (AOM) is proposed for cryptocurrencies in the real world. In AOM, a payee receives micropayments from an 'honest-but-curious' intermediary {\mathcal {T}} by solving puzzles which are generated based on the standard RSA assumption. Meanwhile, {\mathcal {T}} also receives micropayments from the payers by payee's solutions and {\mathcal {T}} will randomly select the inputs of the merging transaction {T}_{\text {mer}}. In order to improve service efficiency of {\mathcal {T}} and resist denial of service attack, one of the outputs of {T}_{\text {mer}} is paid for {\mathcal {T}} as a service fee. Besides, AOM simultaneously ensures the correctness and fairness of transactions. Finally, from the analyses of property and security, AOM has strong unlinkability, ability for anti-attacks and unforgeability. © 2013 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Micropayment; Unlinkability","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Electronic money; Decentralized architecture; Micropayments; Payment schemes; Privacy leakages; RSA assumption; Tamper proof; Trusted party; Unlinkability; Denial-of-service attack","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61472331, 61772434, 61806169); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2016YFB0800601); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (XDJK2018D005)","Manuscript received June 12, 2018; revised September 27, 2018; accepted November 17, 2018.

The relevance of the study is predetermined by the very specifics of such a phenomenon as cryptocurrency consisting of a distributed ledger technology, which determines the peculiarities of issuing, storing and performing operations with cryptocurrency. Moreover, the cryptocurrency turnover directly correlates with the national legislation of individual countries, which are the subject of domestic regulation with currency, tax legislation and legislation on the securities market. Sometimes, in this regard, there is a clash of public interests and the interests of entities involved in the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, as an unconventional, trendy phenomenon of the recent times, has become the object of research and discussions on all the world platforms, starting with academia, continuing with the business community and ending with state institutions. There are many reasons for explaining such interest and they can all be reduced to two main blocks: the advantages and the disadvantages of cryptocurrency circulation. The problem of cryptocurrency turnover, on the one hand, is that until now none of the national economies have regulated the cost-effective mechanism for the cryptocurrency turnover and, on the other hand, the leading countries have not yet set up an effective system of legal regulation of cryptocurrency. Many countries are in the active process of working to adequately address the above problem. Separately, it is worth highlighting the interest of Muslim countries in this issue, where discussions are still underway about the permissibility of cryptocurrency in Islamic law. As for the Russian realities in the context of the issue under study, the Federal Law “On Digital Financial Assets, Digital Currency and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation“, which came into effect on 1 January 2021, was supposed to streamline relations of subjects including cryptocurrencies, but, according to the experts in this field, this law is far from impeccable and this sphere of relations cannot be quickly and effectively regulated. This article describes the characteristics of cryptocurrency, its essence, disadvantages and advantages as an object of economic and civil law relations. The purpose of the research is to analyze the economic and legal phenomenon of cryptocurrency, as well as its characteristics in the Muslim legal system. The complexity of the work should be emphasized as a novelty. Based on the designated goal and the logic of construction, the study consists of three interrelated parts. The first part outlines the characteristics of cryptocurrency as an economic category, the second part is devoted to its legal analysis and the last part of the study demonstrates the Islamic perception (Sharia analysis) of this phenomenon. As a conclusion on the scientific research, we will highlight the following provisions. First, economically, nowadays, cryptocurrency is a rather controversial financial instrument: on the one hand, it has great investment attractiveness, but on the other hand, it is subject to great volatility and seems to be a rather risky financial asset. Secondly, from a legal standpoint, cryptocurrencies have not yet found their consistent consolidation and further legal regulation in the Russian legislation. It seems that the legal regulation of this institution will systematically develop depending on what application and results of its turnover the cryptocurrency will have in the future. Finally, the Islamic interpretation of the cryptocurrency phenomenon boils down to the absence of a single, consistent explanation of it from the perspective of Islam and Sharia as an object of permissibility (or prohibition) of transactions with it. It is necessary to further analyze the practice of using cryptocurrency and its impact on the economy and legal institutions in order to make a final decision on its permissibility or prohibition in correlation with the types of activity and the upcoming consequences associated with it. © 2021 by the authors.","bitcoin; code; cryptocurrency; currency; Islam; Islamic economics; law; mining; money; responsibility; Sharia","","","","","","","","Abubakar Y.S., Ogunbado A.F., Saidi M.A., Bitcoin and its legality from Shariah point of view, Journal of Management, 1, pp. 13-21, (2018); Arkhireeva A.S., Podolyan A.P., The Problem of Legal Regulation of Cryptocurrency in the Russian Federation//Epomen, pp. 28-35, (2020); Borisova O.V., Cryptocurrency as a means of increasing the attractiveness of Russian business, Business Strategy, 41, pp. 17-21, (2017); Chohan U.W., Are Stable Coins Stable?

Although it seems attractive to employ tokens as countermeasures for cryptocurrency leakage, Mosaic is a specific token for the New Economy Movement (NEM) cryptocurrency and is not employed for other blockchain systems or cryptocurrencies. Moreover, although some volunteers tracked leaked NEM using Mosaic in the CoinCheck incident, it would be better to verify that the volunteers can be trusted. Simultaneously, if someone (e.g., who stole cryptocurrencies) can identify the volunteers, then that person or organization may be targets of them. In this paper, we propose an anonymous trust-marking scheme on blockchain systems that is universally applicable to any cryptocurrency. In our scheme, entities called token admitters are allowed to generate tokens adding trustworthiness or untrustworthiness to addresses. Anyone can anonymously verify whether these tokens were issued by a token admitter. Simultaneously, only the designated auditor and no one else, including nondesignated auditors, can identify the token admitters. Our scheme is based on accountable ring signatures and commitment, and is implemented on an elliptic curve called Curve25519, and we confirm that both cryptographic tools are efficient. Moreover, we also confirm that our scheme is applicable to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NEM. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

An increasing number of studies have investigated various aspects of these cryptomarkets' characteristics, such as product categories, sale volumes, and the number of listings and vendors. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding whether illegal transactions (of illicit drugs) take place during the day or week. This study fills this gap by tracing Bitcoin addresses associated with the six previously leading and most active cryptomarkets—Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution, Nucleus, and Abraxas—to identify the specific timings of these transactions. This study reveals clear patterns of activity on the marketplaces. First, transactions more often take place at night in European countries (Germany, Netherlands, the UK), the US, and Canada, where the cryptomarket drug trade is most active. Second, there are more transactions on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and fewer on Saturdays and Sundays. This indicates that the retail drug trade accounts for a large part of the cryptomarkets. Further, this study examines the impact of a cryptomarket policing effort known as Operation Onymous, and indicates that this policing effort only displaced users among these marketplaces and did not deter their activity, even in the short-term. It also suggests that Operation Onymous did not alter users’ transaction patterns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crypto currency; Cybercriminal; Drug economy; Information security","Roads and streets; Silk; European Countries; Government authorities; Illicit drug; Law-enforcement agencies; Netherlands; Product categories; Sale volumes; Transaction patterns; Commerce","","","","","Telecommunications Advancement Foundation, TAF","This study received financial support from the Telecommunications Advancement Foundation (Research Grant 2019 ).","Aldridge J., Askew R., Delivery dilemmas: how drug cryptomarket users identify and seek to reduce their risk of detection by law enforcement, Int.

In the early 1990’s the so called Fuzzy Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ, SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy time series; Non-stationary environment; Online learning; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction","Agricultural robots; Data handling; Financial markets; Knowledge based systems; Membership functions; Computational experiment; Forecasting models; Fuzzy time series model; Imprecise knowledge; Non-stationary environment; Non-stationary fuzzy sets; Non-stationary time series; Perturbation functions; Time series","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Ministry of Education, MOE; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (169392/2017-1, 306850/2016-8, 405911/2017-3); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG","This work was partially financed by the Foundation for Research of the State of Minas Gerais (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG) , by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil , Grants no. 405911/2017-3 ; no. 169392/2017-1 ; and no. 306850/2016-8 and by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) , which is a Brazilian federal government agency under the Ministry of Education.

By using different models and data sources for Bitcoin, we find that GP predicts future Bitcoin return. When the price of gold relative to platinum increases, Bitcoin return also goes up. This finding is consistent with previous studies and contributes to the ongoing discussion whether GP can be used as an indicator for aggregate market risk. Using variance decomposition, we also find that volatility in the gold and platinum market can influence Bitcoin volatility and that this relationship shows time-varying dependency. Finally, our results are robust to including new year effects and data of different frequency. Hence, this paper contributes to the current literature of Bitcoin by showing that GP provides an important proxy of risk in the economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin return; Cryptocurrency; Gold; Platinum","","","","","","","","Alexander C., Dakos M., A critical investigation of cryptocurrency data and analysis, Quant.

Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed some success and 'bitcoin' is now the largest cryptocurrency, with the total number of bitcoins currently valued at approximately 70 billion US dollars. However, globally there are economies which favour the bitcoin and some have banned the same. While many day traders have cash out their funds, veteran traders remain unfazed. In this scenario, it is essential to look into their price behaviour which reveals that there is huge a fluctuation, i.e., highly volatile in nature. Henceforth, their relationships with the trading volume, money supply, lag prices which influences the trade in bitcoin are measured using the ANN model revealing highly significant relationship.  © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","ANN model; Bitcoin prices; Money supply; Trading volume; Volatility","","","","","","","","Ametrano F.M., Hayek Money: the Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution, (2016); Atsalakis G.S., Atsalaki I.G., Pasiouras F., Zopounidis C., Bitcoin price forecasting with neuro-fuzzy techniques, European Journal of Operational Research, 276, 2, pp. 770-780, (2019); Barber S., Boyen X., Shi E., Uzun E., Bitter to better - how to make bitcoin a better currency, International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 399-414, (2012); Brito J., Shadab H.B., Castillo A., Bitcoin financial regulation: Securities, derivatives, prediction markets, and gambling, The Columbia Science & Technology Law Review, 26, 2, pp. 144-221, (2014); Catalini C., Gans J.S., Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain, (2016); Catania L., Grassi S., Ravazzolo F., Forecasting Cryptocurrencies Financial Time Series, (2018); Ciaian P., Rajcaniova M., Kancs D.A., The economics of BitCoin price formation, Applied Economics, 48, 19, pp. 1799-1815, (2016); Crosby M., Pattanayak P., Verma S., Kalyanaraman V., Blockchain technology: beyond bitcoin, Applied Innovation, 2, 2, pp. 6-10, (2016); Egorova N.E., Torzhevsky K.A., Bitcoin: main trends and perspectives, British Journal of Economics, Management & Trade, 12, 1, pp. 1-11, (2016); Everaere P., Simplot-Ryl I., Traore I., Double spending protection for e-cash based on risk management, International Conference on Information Security, pp. 394-408, (2010); Friedlmaier M., Tumasjan A., Welpe I.M., Disrupting industries with blockchain: the industry, venture capital funding, and regional distribution of blockchain ventures, Proceedings of the 51st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), (2018); Harvey C.R., Cryptofinance, (2016); Hayes A.S., Cryptocurrency value formation: an empirical study leading to a cost of production model for valuing bitcoin, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1308-1321, (2017); Hileman G., Rauchs M., Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study, (2017); Kara Y., Boyacioglu M.A., Baykan O.K., Predicting direction of stock price index movement using artificial neural networks and support vector machines: the sample of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Expert systems with Applications, 38, 5, pp. 5311-5319, (2011); Karame G., Androulaki E., Capkun S., Two bitcoins at the price of one?

The study aims to analyze the risk measures for the bitcoin and comparing with tradable asset classes that include the Standard and Poor’s BSE 500, USD, Euro, GBP and the Gold future prices. The study uses the GARCH models to identify the components of world economies that bitcoin is sensitive too as against variables that impact the global financial prudence. The empirical results of the study reveal that against dollar and euro exchange rates bitcoin returns are more sensitive. Bitcoin can be used together with gold to diversify or eliminate explicit market risks. The study presents reasonable justification over the development and relationship between bitcoin and different traded assets that pose new challenges before the global investors. The implication of this paper for the strategic policy makers shows the sensitivity among tradeable assets.

In this paper, we analyse the structure of the BLN over a period of 18 months, ranging from 12th January 2018 to 17th July 2019, at the end of which the network has reached 8.216 users, 122.517 active channels and 2.732,5 transacted Bitcoins. Here, we consider three representations of the BLN: the daily snapshot one, the weekly snapshot one and the daily-block snapshot one. By studying the topological properties of the binary and weighted versions of the three representations above, we find that the total volume of transacted Bitcoins approximately grows as the square of the network size; however, despite the huge activity characterising the BLN, the Bitcoins distribution is very unequal: the average Gini coefficient of the node strengths (computed across the entire history of the Bitcoin lightning network) is, in fact, ≃0.88 causing the 10% (50%) of the nodes to hold the 80% (99%) of the Bitcoins at stake in the BLN (on average, across the entire period). This concentration brings up the question of which minimalist network model allows us to explain the network topological structure. Like for other economic systems, we hypothesise that local properties of nodes, like the degree, ultimately determine part of its characteristics. Therefore, we have tested the goodness of the undirected binary configuration model (UBCM) in reproducing the structural features of the BLN: the UBCM recovers the disassortative and the hierarchical character of the BLN but underestimates the centrality of nodes; this suggests that the BLN is becoming an increasingly centralised network, more and more compatible with a core-periphery structure. Further inspection of the resilience of the BLN shows that removing hubs leads to the collapse of the network into many components, an evidence suggesting that this network may be a target for the so-called split attacks.  © 2020 The Author(s).

The combination of a public health emergency, economic distress, and misinformation-driven panic have pushed customers and vendors towards the shadow economy. In particular, dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial websites accessible via free software, have gained significant popularity. Here, we analyse 851,199 listings extracted from 30 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020. We identify 788 listings directly related to COVID-19 products and monitor the temporal evolution of product categories including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medicines (e.g., hydroxyclorochine), and medical frauds. Finally, we compare trends in their temporal evolution with variations in public attention, as measured by Twitter posts and Wikipedia page visits. We reveal how the online shadow economy has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of a continuous monitoring of DWMs, especially now that real vaccines are available and in short supply. We anticipate our analysis will be of interest both to researchers and public agencies focused on the protection of public health. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; COVID-19; Dark Web Marketplaces; Shadow economy","Protective clothing; Public health; Vaccines; Commercial websites; Continuous monitoring; Health emergencies; Personal protective equipment; Product categories; Public agencies; Shadow economies; Temporal evolution; Commerce","","","","","Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2039693, 1717062); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/V00400X/1)","A.Br., M.N., A.T., A.G and A.Ba. were supported by ESRC as part of UK Research and Innovation\u2019s rapid response to COVID-19, through grant ES/V00400X/1.

The pandemic disrupted entrepreneurship and business activities by creating challenges and opportunities in the digital economy. In the digital economy, the majority of the businesses migrated and adopted online business and entrepreneurship activities to sustain the economic growth of Middle East. To assess ways through which the pandemic has affected entrepreneurship in the Digital Economy of Middle East. The study adopted the qualitative method for data collection and analysis. In this regard, purposeful sampling was used to select participants before interviews were administered to collect data. The collected data was analyzed through the thematic method. The pandemic led to the increase in the use of technologies for entrepreneurship purposes, thus increasing awareness and improvement of the digital economy. The digital economy in Middle East has experienced a revolution creating transformations for entrepreneurship to adopt alternative methods to undertake business. In this regard, the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has forced various entrepreneurs in the digital economy in Middle East to shift from traditional marketing and working styles to online digital marketing. As a Result, the pandemic affected entrepreneurship, causing them to adopt the digital economy for survival. © 2021, Allied Business Academies.

Since cryptocurrency is generated and consumed by Blockchain systems, Blockchain-specific information can be considered as the main component in forecasting the values of cryptocurrency. This perspective has been widely adopted in studies of Bitcoin price predictions. However, we find that Ethereum, a popular and leading cryptocurrency in the market, has Blockchain information that differs from that of Bitcoin. Hence, this study investigates the relationship between inherent Ethereum Blockchain information and Ethereum prices. Furthermore, we investigate how Blockchain information concerning other publicly available coins on the market is associated with Ethereum prices. Our key findings reveal that macro-economy factors, Ethereum-specific Blockchain information, and the Blockchain information of other cryptocurrency play important roles in the prediction of Ethereum prices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain information;

This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on the time-frequency connectedness between Green Bonds and other financial assets. Our sample includes the global stock market, bond market, oil, USD index, and two popular hedging alternatives, namely Gold and Bitcoin, from May 2013 to August 2020. First, we apply the methodologies of Diebold and Yilmaz (International Journal of Forecasting, 2012, 28(1), 57–66) and Baruník and Křehlík (Journal of Financial Econometrics, 2018, 16(2), 271–296). Then, we estimate hedge ratios and hedge effectiveness of green bonds for other financial assets. Green bonds are found to have a great weight in the overall network, particularly strongly connected with the USD index and bond index. While the bi-directional relationship with USD persists during COVID, the connectedness with conventional bonds is also strengthened. Notably, we find a weak relationship between Green bonds and Bitcoin, both in the short and long run. As portfolio implications, Gold and USD have the highest hedge ratio, which is confirmed by the hedging effectiveness. In contrast, oil and stocks exhibit the lowest hedging effectiveness. Our findings imply that financial assets might have a heterogeneous relationship with green bonds. Furthermore, despite its infancy, it seems that the role of green bond during a crisis should not be ignored, as it can be a hedger for some assets, while a contagion amplifier during crisis times. © Copyright © 2021 Naeem, Mbarki, Alharthi, Omri and Shahzad.","COVID19; green bonds; hedging effectiveness; network connectedness; time and frequency domain","","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/SPP/3347); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI","MN gratefully acknowledges the support of Science Foundation Ireland under grant number 16/SPP/3347.","Adekoya O.B., Oliyide J.A., How COVID-19 Drives Connectedness Among Commodity and Financial Markets: Evidence from TVP-VAR and Causality-In-Quantiles Techniques, Resour.

Our results suggest that the unconditional connectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets is negligible. However, conditional analysis uncovers periods of substantial shock transmission between Bitcoin and traditional assets. This finding undermines the potential of Bitcoin as a hedge to traditional assets and shows that market disruptions can spread from Bitcoin to the traditional economy. The increasing market capitalization of cryptocurrencies further strengthens the importance of such findings. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Asymmetric effects; C58; Connectedness; Cryptocurrencies; E49; Realized semivariance; Subject classification codes: C38; Volatility","","","","","","Grant Agency of Charles University; Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK, (846217); Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (GA16-14151S)","Funding text 1: Support from the Czech Science Foundation under project no.

Firstly, by applying the dynamic time warping algorithm, we identify among several financial instruments a subsample of five assets with similar characteristics to the cryptocurrency bubble. Interestingly, among the fluctuations characterizing these assets, the algorithm shows a close affinity between the Bitcoin bubble and the 2000 NASDAQ Dotcom one. Once the subsample is identified, we study the (de)synchronization among these assets via the wavelet coherence approach. Although Bitcoin is poorly correlated with the other indices, given its scarce connection with the real economy, we observe switching phenomena among these instruments. A more careful study on these portfolio reallocations, conducted via an event study analysis, reveals that traders seem to redirect capital from stock markets and gold to Bitcoin in case of positive events of the cryptocurrency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Assets synchronization; Bubbles; Cryptocurrencies; Hedging","","","","","","","","Baek C., Elbeck M., Bitcoins as an investment or speculative vehicle? a first look, Appl.

It has attracted much public attention due to its innovative technology and its high currency exchange rate volatility. In this paper, Bitcoin’s exchange rate movement from 2011 to 2018 and its relationship with the global financial markets are explored using an EGARCH framework. The results are as follows. First, fundamentals and Bitcoin-related specific events play a critical role in the formation of its exchange rate. Second, the impact on Bitcoin of regulation-related events indicates that market sentiment responds to market regulation statements. Third, news coverage is an essential factor in driving its volatility. Fourth, Bitcoin can be a hedge in times of low uncertainty in global financial markets and can also serve as a safe haven against high economic uncertainty worldwide, but with increasing global financial uncertainty, it is likely to move with the markets and therefore cannot serve as a hedge or safe haven against stock market crashes. Lastly, the positive effect of global expansionary monetary policy on Bitcoin’s exchange rate is marginal enough to rule out the involvement of central banks worldwide in the inflation of Bitcoin’s exchange rate over the years, as may have been the case with many asset prices after the 2008 US financial crisis. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; EGARCH; Event analysis; Financial markets; Reuters news","currency; exchange rate; financial crisis; financial market; global economy; mass media; time series analysis","","","","","Michael Funke; Deutsche Bundesbank","Funding text 1: I am grateful for comments from Michael Funke.

Bitcoins are associated with alpha-numeric addresses and are transferred via transactions. Each transaction is composed of a set of input addresses (associated with unspent outputs received from previous transactions) and a set of output addresses (to which Bitcoins are transferred). Despite Bitcoin was designed with anonymity in mind, different heuristic approaches exist to detect which addresses in a specific transaction belong to the same entity. By applying these heuristics, we build an Address Correspondence Network: in this representation, addresses are nodes are connected with edges if at least one heuristic detects them as belonging to the same entity. In this paper, we analyze for the first time the Address Correspondence Network and show it is characterized by a complex topology, signaled by a broad, skewed degree distribution and a power-law component size distribution. Using a large-scale dataset of addresses for which the controlling entities are known, we show that a combination of external data coupled with standard community detection algorithms can reliably identify entities. The complex nature of the Address Correspondence Network reveals that usage patterns of individual entities create statistical regularities; and that these regularities can be leveraged to more accurately identify entities and gain a deeper understanding of the Bitcoin economy as a whole. © Copyright © 2021 Fischer, Palechor, Dell’Aglio, Bernstein and Tessone.","bitcoin (BTC); blockchain technology; deanonymization; label propagarion algorithm; network science","Bitcoin; Complex networks; Heuristic methods; Large dataset; Bitcoin; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Community structures; Complex topology; Deanonymization; Decentralised; Heuristics approaches; Label propagaria algorithm; Network science; Blockchain","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (407550_167177); Universität Zürich, UZH","DD acknowledges partial funding from by the Swiss National Science foundation under contract #407550_167177.

Relying on distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain), the method of “tokenization” now seems to be the next way for digital economics to be actualised in practise. Digitalizing some of the production and selling processes through crypto-tokenization technology has brought with it new perspectives and opportunities. Any thorough consideration of the logic of “distributed systems” applied to economics is bound to see that it potentially brings considerable disruptions and significant changes in how companies get access to funding. Cryptocurrencies, and subsequently “tokens” initially issued from “initial coin offerings” (ICOs) have answered an obvious need for efficient, borderless, and secure flows of capital. This article first summarizes what early academic research tells us about ICOs based on DLTs and their factors of success. We then use the case of LakeDiamond, a Swiss venture in the business of growing and polishing synthetic diamonds, to present and contextualize the process of holding an ICO, which ultimately did not succeed. In the final section, we present two fund raising models that have recently gained traction and popularity, namely “security token offerings” (STOs) and “initial exchange offerings” (IEOs), and highlight their main advantages compared to ICOs. © 2020 Carleton University.

For comparative purposes, Bitcoin is also compared to currencies such as the Great Britain Pound, Mexican Peso and Special Drawing Rights to determine whether Bitcoin values change like currencies. Some evidence showed changes in the value of Bitcoin were weakly similar to store-of-wealth commodities like gold and silver. Overall, the election-window volatility of cryptocurrencies was much higher than the preceding one-year average for the BREXIT vote but less volatile than the one-year average for the US election vote. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bitcoin; commodities; cryptocurrencies; forex markets; National elections","United Kingdom; United States; commodity; comparative study; currency devaluation; election; electronic commerce; European Union; political change; political economy","","","","","","","Belke A., Dubova I., Osowski T., Policy Uncertainty and International Financial Markets: The Case of Brexit, Applied Economics, 50, 34-35, pp. 3752-3770, (2018); Burdekin R., Hughson E., Gu J., A First Look at Brexit and Global Equity Markets, Applied Economics Letters, 25, 2, pp. 136-140, (2018); The Federal Reserve and You: Functions and Characteristics of Money, (2013); Griffin J.M., Shams A., Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?, (2018); (2017); Hobolt S., The Brexit Vote: A Divided Nation, A Divided Continent, Journal of European Public Policy, 23, 9, pp. 1259-1277, (2016); Houben R., Snyers A., Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, Study Conducted for the European Parliament, (2019); Internal Revenue Service Notice 2014-21.

Besides, it sets the goal to find out specific features of Petro (PTR) and its operation as Venezuelan national cryptocurrency. The methodological basis consists of general scientific methods of cognition to include analysis, synthesis, and comparison. The special methods such as content analysis of official documents as well as economic analysis are also applied in the article. The research produced some key findings: recent surveys confirm its new function of becoming a convenient means of payment in the environment of the cash absence, and a means of survival for many families living in the environment of a deepening economic crisis and sanctions introduce by the USA. The main outcomes imply that the national cryptocurrency PRT has some advantages over other cryptocurrencies, one of them being the fact that unlike Bitcoin and other currencies it is issued by the Venezuelan government and has a state guarantee of reliability and stability when operating in the country. However, it is not without disadvantages, the main one being the possibility of its anonymous usage which has resulted in an increased flow of illegal transactions and a larger shadow economy which has grown significantly in Venezuela. The main conclusions drawn from the research are that the introduction of the national cryptocurrency had produced a positive impact on the economic development of the country. In fact, it resulted in an increase in the number of financial transactions within the country; it led to additional opportunities concerning exchanges with other countries and international financing of Venezuela by third parties; the cryptocurrency contributed to the integration of Venezuela into a new type of the world market. © 2020, Institute of Latin American Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Economic sanctions; Electronic money; Electronic wallet; Mining; Petro; Venezuela","","","","","","","","Giddens E.H., Uskolzayuschiy mir: kak globalizatsiya menyaet nashu zhizn [Changing world: how globalization is changing our lives], (2004); Anokhin N.V., Shmyreva A.I., Kriptovaliuta kak instrument finansovogo rynka, Idei i idealy, 3, 2, pp. 39-49, (2018); Hileman G., Rauchs M., Global cryptocurrency benchmarking study, (2017); Cryptocurrency Overview&#x2026;, (2017); Halpern S., Bitcoin mania, New York Review of Books, 65, 1, pp. 3-57, (2018); Russo M., Distribution of digital currency owners in the countries, World economy, 15, pp. 18-21, (2019); Dogieva M.M., Zarubezhniy opyt pravovogo regulirovaniya otnosheniy v sfere oborota kriptovaliyuty, Zarubezhnoe pravo, Moscow, 10, 143, pp. 116-128, (2018); Véase más sobre la criptodivisa en América Latina: Tamara V.

What may be called the lex cryptographia of blockchain has been designed based on a rational choice vision of human behavior. Blockchain adopts a framing derived from neoclassical economics, and instantiates it in a new machinery that implements rational choice paradigms using blockchain in a semi-automatic way, across all spheres of life, and without regard to borders.

The right action is related to massive stock market measurements. Therefore, defining the right action requires specific knowledge from investors. The economy scientists, following their research, have suggested several strategies and indicating factors that serve to find the best option for trading in a stock market. However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market. As a result, we developed an application that observes historical price movements and takes action on real-time prices. We tested our proposal algorithm with three-Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH)-crypto coins' historical data. The experiment on Bitcoin via DRL application shows that the investor got 14.4% net profits within one month. Similarly, tests on Litecoin and Ethereum also finished with 74% and 41% profit, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","Day trading; Deep reinforcement learning; Double cross strategy; Machine learning; Moving average; Position trading; Scalping; Swing trading; Trading","","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (2018R1D1A1B07043417); Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2018R1D1A1B07043417).","Osborne M.F., Brownian motion in the stock market, Oper.

Considering the specific nature of the continent, is this digital currency going to be a propelling factor for its growth? In this paper, we investigate the correlation and dependence structure between bitcoin and eight African currencies using two different concepts, including extreme correlation plots and a bivariate extreme value model due to Gumbel (Bull Inst Int de Stat 37:471475, 1960). The currencies are chosen to correspond to eight biggest economies in Africa. We identify those African currencies having a positive correlation with bitcoin and those having a negative correlation with bitcoin. The dependence quantified can have economic implications. We perform a robustness study to see if the results hold also for parts of the data. We provide economic interpretations of the results which could be of interest to researchers, policy makers and bitcoin investors within the region and beyond. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Correlation coefficient; Dependence coefficient; Gumbel","","","","","","","","Asefa T., Assessing The Role of Cryptocurrency Project in Ethiopia: The Case Study of Achiversklub School of Cryptocurrency, (2018); Berger L.L., Bitcoin Exchange Transactions: Income Tax Implications to Consider within the South African Environment.

This paper examined a total of 67,166 panel data of financial stocks in the two emerging markets of Taiwan and China between July 2016 and April 2019, presenting the following significant findings. (1) Financial stocks in Taiwan’s market are more greatly shocked by the bitcoin and interaction effect between bitcoin and fin-tech than those in China’s market. (2) Even after changing proxy variable or autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity are considered, the asymmetric shocks on financial stocks in Taiwan’s market are still great. (3) The effects of the two variables of bitcoin and interaction with fin-tech on financial stocks are consistently important as the three-factor CAPM model. (4) Transmitted by the changes in currency supply and demand as well as exchange rate volatilities, the spillover effects of virtual currencies and financial innovation indirectly change the currency multiplier of the home country, investors’ sensibility to interest rates, and balance of import and export trades and may eventually impact the gross outputs and inflation of individual economies. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

For this purpose, we have performed the bootstrap full, and the sub-sample rolling-window Granger causality tests, in order to explore the mutual influences between geopolitical risks (GPR) and Bitcoin prices (BCP). We have found that there are positive and negative influences that stem from GPR towards BCP. In this regard, the positive impacts ascertain that the Bitcoin currency can be considered as an asset that is developed in order to avoid GPR. However, this view cannot be held constant and absolute, without considering the negative effects of such an arrangement. Moreover, it is noteworthy that these results are not supported by the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM), which highlights that BCP can be positively affected by GPR. On the flipside, there is a positive influence extended from BCP towards GPR, which suggests that the Bitcoin market is a leading indicator that can be used to analyze the global geopolitical environment more accurately and comprehensively. Therefore, in situations involving severe global uncertainty and complicated geopolitical patterns, investors can benefit from the Bitcoin market in order to optimize their investments during the periods where the GPR are higher. Moreover, governments can also adopt, accept and boost the trend of BCP by considering valid GPR, and further promote the advances in encryption technology. They can also strengthen their supervision, in order to promote a healthy development of the Bitcoin market, which in turn is a significant indicator of the macroeconomic and political trends across the globe. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin price; Causal relationship; Geopolitical risks; Rolling-window","Costs; Cryptography; Investments; Capital asset pricing model; Encryption technologies; Geopolitical events; Geopolitical risks; Global uncertainty; Granger causality test; Leading indicators; Rolling window; bootstrapping; currency; geopolitics; Granger causality test; investment; macroeconomics; political economy; Bitcoin","","","","","","","Al-Yahyaee K.H., Rehman M.U., Mensi W., Al-Jarrah I.M.W., Can uncertainty indices predict Bitcoin prices?

This article examines how the rise of bitcoin has particular geographies and trajectories of uneven development across the globe. The generation (or ‘mining’) of cryptocurrencies is computationally-intensive, requiring computer hardware, cool air and cheap energy. Adopting the case study of Quebec, Canada, we show how these variables interact to produce a relationship between digital currencies, economic imaginaries and space in the regions where cryptomining is clustered. We argue that these new geographies of cryptocurrency ‘mining’ leave residual marks on the regions where they are located but remain highly mobile – moving from location to location in search of the cheap energy that supports private accumulation. Adopting an illustrative case study of Quebec, Canada, we work to render visible the materiality of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Far from existing both nowhere and everywhere, the generation of bitcoin is foregrounded in local contexts and regional economic imaginaries with both spatial and social implications for the cities and towns where cryptomining takes place. We conclude with a call for further research into this emergent ‘crypto-regionalism’ and its consequences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Economic imaginaries; Energy demand; Political economy; Quebec; Uneven development","Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Quebec [Quebec (PRV)]; currency market; demand-side management; economic conditions; economic development; political economy; regional economy","","","","","","","Agnew J., The new global economy: time-space compression, geopolitics, and global uneven development, J.

At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings: The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in South Africa. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption. Studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain;

This study aimed to thoroughly investigate the topics and methodologies used in information system throughout a twelve-year period (20072018). In the present study, all the articles published in the top eight information system journals were investigated based on their topics and methodologies using a literature analysis approach, and the most common topics and methodologies in such studies were then detected. The main topics addressed in this field were electronic commerce/business, information system research, and IS usage/adoption, and the survey was the dominant research methodology in this regard. Furthermore, an increase in the use of the mathematical models indicates that more accurate quantitative research methods have made this field more mature. The research findings also show that the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, social media, bitcoin and block chain, digital transformation, sharing economy, digital platform, methodology of machine learning, data mining, and text mining are the main research topics and methods which should be further studied. © 2020.

We employed a rich set of established empirical approaches, including a VAR framework, a copulas approach, and non-parametric drawings, to capture a dependence structure. Using a weekly dataset from 2013 to 2017, our key results suggest that the frequency of Google searches leads to positive returns and a surge in Bitcoin trading volume. Shocks to search values have a positive effect, which persisted for at least a week. Our findings contribute to the debate on cryptocurrencies/Bitcoins and have profound implications in terms of understanding their dynamics, which are of special interest to investors and economic policymakers. © 2019, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Financial innovation; Forecasting; Google search values","","","","","","University of Economics","There is no external funding to declare.

I test this hypothesis by exploiting cross-country shadow market variation and exogenous shocks to darknet marketplaces used exclusively for illegal transactions in 28 emerging market economies. I find that Bitcoin trade volume generated by underground activity reacts much more strongly to inflation expectations than Bitcoin trade volume among the general population, providing direct evidence that shadow market participants substitute away from cash and towards cryptocurrency to conduct anonymous transactions. This effect is particularly strong among countries experiencing high annual inflation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; Currency substitution; Inflation expectations; Shadow economy","","","","","","","","Blackburn K., Bose N., Capasso S., Tax evasion, the underground economy and financial development, J.

Utilizing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the Generalized Quantile Regression (GQR) estimation techniques, the paper illustrates that the current CEPU has a positive impact on the returns of Bitcoin. However, the positive impact is statistically significant only at the higher quantiles of the current CEPU. It is concluded that Bitcoin can be used in hedging against policy uncertainties in China since significant rises in uncertainty leads to a higher return in Bitcoin.

It is the Virtual/ Crypto Currencies. First, it should be noted that this term is a new one, and therefore, we cannot find any reference to virtual currencies in the old writings of Muslim scholars. Furthermore, and according to the different views of economic systems, the function of currencies is still a contradictory issue. Indeed, most economists consider the traditional functions of money as being the real ones, and Muslim scholars approve this view assuring that money is a means of exchange as well as a measure of values. Accordingly, most central banks focus on these two functions for the purpose of achieving a level of stability among prices. Similarly, interpretations of Islamic Law assure that money shall be protected from any type of waste. On the contrary, there shall be constant efforts for exploiting and increasing money. Hence, money, and as stated above, is a measure of values and not a commodity to be traded or speculated through the internet without being supervised by central banks or other authorities, which regulate the work of financial institutions. This study is constituted of three main parts. While the first part focuses on the functions and features of money as viewed by Muslim jurists, the second part deals with the types, features and functions of virtual currencies, and how they are viewed by Muslim scholars. The third and last part attempts to show the legal implications of dealing with virtual/crypto currencies, and their impact on the countries’ economies. © 2021,Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.All Rights Reserved.","Bitcoin; Block Chain; Electronic Currencies; Mining; Money; Virtual/Crypto Currencies","","","","","","","","Al Fayrouz A., Ya'qub M.B., Al Qamoos Al-Muheet, (2005); Ghazali Al, Abu H.M.B.M., Revival of Religion Sciences, (2004); Al Matalga, Fawaz M., Al Wajeez in Electronic Commerce Contracts, (2007); Al Maqrizi., Taqiuddin A., Al Abbas A.B.A., Relief of the Nation through the Reveal of Sorrow, (2007); Al N., Abi A., Al H., Al Mustadrak, (2001); Al R., Qadir M.B.A.B.A., Mukhtar Al Sahah, (1986); Abdulaziz B., Suleiman A.B., Virtual Currencies: Concept, Types and Economic Effects, Scientific Journal of Economics and Trade, (2017); Zakaria B., Faris A.B., Dictionary of Language Standards, (1979); Ibn Khaldun, Muhammad W.A.R.B., Introduction: History of the Scholar Ibn Khaldun (First Edition), (2004); Ibn Q., Ahmed A.B., Al Mughni; Fdhil M.A., Aqeel S., Electronic Money as a Credit Instrument: Legal Adjustment.

This study aper analyses how key factors underpinning the success of this ground-breaking “Internet of value” technology, such as staking of collateral (“skin in the game”), competitive crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and prediction markets, can be applied to substantially innovate the legacy organization of science, research, and technology development (RTD). Here, we elaborate a highly integrative, community-based strategy where a token-based crypto-economy supports finding best possible consensus, trust, and truth by adding unconventional elements known from reputation systems, betting, secondary markets, and social networking. These tokens support the holder’s formalized reputation and are used in liquid-democracy style governance and arbitration within projects or community-driven initiatives. This participatory research model serves as a solid basis for comprehensively leveraging collective intelligence by effectively incentivizing contributions from the crowd, such as intellectual property work, validation, assessment, infrastructure, education, assessment, governance, publication, and promotion of projects. On the analogy of its current blockbusters like peer-to-peer structured decentralized finance (“DeFi”), blockchain technology can seminally enhance the efficiency of science and RTD initiatives, even permitting to fully stage operations as a chiefless decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs).

Design/methodology/approach: First, this study tests if the Law of One Price (LOOP) is valid for bitcoin prices in Brazil, conducting tests with data from three Brazilian exchanges. Next, this study documents bitcoin price dynamics in the short run by studying the price discovery mechanism in these exchanges. This study uses Information Share and Component Share, combining the two measures to obtain an Information Leadership Share (ILS) measure. Findings: This study finds a common trend within bitcoin prices among a set of exchanges, with cointegration tests between the price series indicating that LOOP is valid in Brazilian markets in the long run. ILS indicated that, for closing prices, the most liquid exchange (Foxbit) leads discovery, whereas the least liquid (Local Bitcoin) lags, with Mercado Bitcoin in the middle both in terms of discovery and liquidity. Finally, this study provides evidence that the price variation in the market that leads price discovery can be used to construct an arbitrage in another exchange. Originality/value: This research brings the first evidence of a price discovery mechanism for exchanges in Brazilian Reais. Although LOOP is valid in the long run, price leadership in bitcoin markets potentially create arbitrage opportunities in the short run. This study contributes to the growing literature of bitcoin prices with novel evidence from a large emerging economy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Law of One Price; Price Discovery","","","","","","","","Aggarwal N., Information share and component share weights: R implementation, Technical report, (2021); Aggarwal N., Thomas S., When stock futures dominate price discovery, Journal of Futures Markets, 39, 3, pp. 263-278, (2018); Baillie R.T., Booth G.G., Tse Y., Zabotina T., Price discovery and common factor models, Journal of Financial Markets, 5, 3, pp. 309-321, (2002); Perguntas e respostas: Moedas virtuais’, webpage, (2020); Bekaert G., Harvey C.R., Research in emerging markets finance: looking to the future, Emerging Markets Review, 3, 4, pp. 429-448, (2002); Brandvold M., Molnar P., Vagstad K., Valstad O.C.A., Price discovery on bitcoin exchanges, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 36, pp. 18-35, (2015); Brauneis A., Mestel R., Cryptocurrency-portfolios in a mean-variance framework, Finance Research Letters, 28, pp. 259-264, (2019); Carrick J., Bitcoin as a complement to emerging market currencies, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 52, 10, pp. 2321-2334, (2016); Chaim P., Laurini M.P., Is bitcoin a bubble?, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 517, pp. 222-232, (2019); Ciaian P., Rajcaniova M., Kancs D., The economics of BitCoin price formation, Applied Economics, 48, 19, pp. 1799-1815, (2016); Cole S., Sampson T., Zia B., Prices or knowledge?

The publication of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008 raised the prospect of global digital currencies without central issuers or intermediaries. While crypto-currencies have yet to achieve the status of money, the underlying ‘token’ technology has prompted big tech interest in stablecoins and central banks to evaluate novel forms of national currency issuance. Although crypto has captured the column inches, most real-world action in payments since 2008 has been elsewhere — the rollout of instant payments schemes, the adoption of electronic money wallets by hundreds of millions of people and the FinTech revolution. This paper suggests that we stand at a crossroads. Will the future of money be digital tokens, restructuring the financial system as we know it, or a much needed overhaul of account-based payments?. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Central bank digital currency (CBDC); Crypto-currency; Digital identity; Instant payments; Stablecoin","","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, (2008); Buterin V., Ethereum Whitepaper, (2013); The Digital Dollar Project: exploring a US CBDC, (2020); Nakamoto; Insurance beyond digital: The rise of ecosystems and platforms, (2018); Birch D., Identity is the New Money, (2014); Fulmer L., Global card fraud losses reach $16.31 billion — will exceed $35 billion in 2020 according to The Nilson Report, (2015); Digital identification: A key to inclusive growth, (2019); Background guide to proposed RTGS functionality: Synchronisation, (2019); Europe’s answer to Libra — potential and prerequisites of a programmable euro, (2020); The Libra Whitepaper, (2019); Principles for financial market infrastructures, (2012); Enhancing cross-border payments: building blocks of a global roadmap, (2020); Basel III definition of capital-Frequently asked questions, (2011); Buterin V., Vitalik Buterin speech in Deconomy 2018, (2018)","T.

On the basis of a review of the available literature and evidence, it is clear that certain technological innovations, such as the movement towards electronic money, will undoubtedly change how we operate. However, the conclusion in this paper is less sanguine regarding the prospects of a global currency, regional monetary unions, or states’ exit from or central banks’ control of money. This paper also sees poor prospects for cryptocurrencies at the moment, given their focus on the decentralisation and politicisation of money, because money requires a backstopping force, making it inherently political. Finally, this paper considers how regulators may seek to ensure that money in its digital form is not taken advantage of and applied in malevolent activities. The study used correlation to establish the level of association among variables. A multiple regression analysis was used to draw an econometric model explaining the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The following variables were used as independent variables: monetary aggregate (M1), harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), US dollar/euro, and the USD value of Bitcoin. Multiple regression predicted that when inflation rises, the money supply will decrease. M1 includes cash in circulation, current deposits, and other than demand deposits. The study concludes that price increases encourage people to keep their money in longer-term deposits, including in cryptocurrency. Additionally, an increase in EURIBOR and US dollar/euro reduces the supply of money. Otherwise, an increase in the price of bitcoin in the economy would increase the overall money supply. © 2021 by the authors.

Using variants of the multivariate conditional heteroscedasticity models and a dummy, we assess the economic potential, each for Bitcoin and Ripple, from the perspective of an emerging market investor. The results, from both time and frequency analyses indicate that the two major cryptocurrency assets have not yet coupled with the emerging assets, as weaker to lower-moderate correlations characterise movements of the pairs. Additionally, our results unveil a multifaceted economic benefit of Bitcoin and Ripple, however, this varies across emerging asset classes (forex and equities), country-specific assets, and regional emerging market groupings.

This study aims to elucidate the popularity of this technology in the Kingdom by means of a small survey. The present study also investigates areas related to cryptocurrency, such as people's trust in banks. The results from the survey are contrasted with other countries to obtain a global perspective regarding Morocco's placement in the cryptocurrency adoption spectrum. The results also suggest that Morocco has the potential to adopt this technology. Notably, 9% of the sample population claim that they have owned, or still own, some sort of cryptocurrency.

With a surplus of nuclear power generation, one of the modern tools for using excess electricity is directing it to cryptocurrency mining. The author of the article will try to calculate the possibilities of Ukrainian NPPs in the cryptoindustry market by analyzing the competitiveness, market trends and the approximate profitability of this kind of activity. The essence of the article lies in the intervention of the state energy giant in completely new activities, partial monopolization of the market and interference in the activities of decentralized cryptocurrencies, as well as the very novelty of combining two different fields of activity and the global nature of the consequences. Mining can be used to convert the underdeveloped electricity or all of Energoatom's capacities totally, but at the same time it can also affect the cryptoasset market in the field of decentralization, as the primary cost factor to affect the price of assets and allow for obtaining super-profits at a state enterprise. The author of the article tries to understand the profitability of such actions and, in general, to understand the globality of the idea. The results of the entry of the national energy giant into the cryptoasset market will change the global processes in the ecosystem of the cryptoindustry and change the situation both on the electricity market in the region and, in general, will affect the processes of globalization and unification of the financial sectors of the economy.  © 2020.

It is a trend that uses idea of presale of cryptocurrency or token to raise fund for a blockchain project. Raising fund through Initial Coin Offering (ICO) captured the pace with the launch of Bitcoin blockchain in 2013 and Ethereum blockchain in 2014. ICO provides great opportunities for promising projects, boosting the economy and creating the ease of doing business. Many projects ideas could not be materialized due to hassles of legal paper work but introduction of ICO has paved the way towards breaking the barriers of crowd funding and unnecessary paperwork involved for raising capital through an ICO. A SWOT analysis is presented in the paper which throws light on importance of ICO in revolutionizing the concept of fund raising and at same time discussion is done on the risk associated with ICO’s. © IJSTR 2020.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Digit tokens; E funding; Initial coin offerings; Smart contract; SWOT","","","","","","","","Vaddepalli S., Antoney L., Are Economic Factors Driving BitCoin Transactions?

Thus in this study, we model the crypto market volatility behavior during the COVID-19 crisis. GARCH (1, 1) and GJR-GARCH (1, 1) were applied to model the volatility clustering and leverage effects in the intraday day (15-minute interval) returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin ranging from 11th April 2019 to 8th February 2021. The empirical findings from GARCH (1, 1) model indicates the presence of volatility clustering in the crypto market. Moreover, the results of the GJR-GARCH (1, 1) indicate the presence of leverage effects in the financial returns series of all three crypto currencies. Furthermore, the excess kurtosis confirms the existence of fat-tail phenomena in the crypto market. Overall, the findings from this study showed that in times of COVID-19 pandemic the crypto market returns series showed volatility persistence, fat-tail phenomena, and leverage effects. These outcomes provide a better understanding for financial investors to invest rationally and cautiously during pandemic times. © 2021, Weissberg SRL.

The study determines that cryptocurrency is the simplest investment asset being and, at the same time, the riskiest one. Advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency use are specified. Advantages include: code openness, anonymity, decentralization, emission, and reliability. Disadvantages include lack of guarantees, instability, risk of prohibition and possible loss. A model to forecast bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange rate is proposed and substantiated mathematically. The observations are the basis to develop a hypothesis: the faster the cryptocurrency (e.g. bitcoin) is mined, the more difficult it is to forecast bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange rate. Certain factors emphasize which may affect the cryptocurrency exchange rate: trade wars of the USA with other export-oriented world economies (China); advent of IEO as the alternative for ICO and new drivers connected with the interest in cryptocurrency; FATF recommendations for market control, the entry of world giants (e.g. Facebook) into the crypto-market and the development of the stablecoin market. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Cryptocurrency accounting; Cryptocurrency exchange; Information; Instability; Intangible asset; Stablecoin","","","","","","","","Adamik F., Kosta S., Smartexchange: Decentralised trustless cryptocurrency exchange, International Conference on Business Information Systems, pp. 356-367, (2019); Adhami S., Giudici G., Martinazzi S., Why do businesses go crypto?

These new types of assets are characterized by wild swings in prices, and this can lead to large swings in profit and losses. To respond to these dynamics, cryptoinvestors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of portfolio selection and optimization. Bitcoin returns have shown some form of regime change, suggesting that regime-switching models could more adequately capture the volatility dynamics. This paper presents a two-state Markov-switching COGARCH-R-vine (MSCOGARCH) model for cryptocurrency portfolio selection and compares the performance to the single-regime COGARCH-R-vine (COGARCH). The findings here are in line with the literature where MSCOGARCH outperforms the single-regime COGARCH with regard to the expected shortfall risk. The COGARCH specifications here capture the structural breaks and heavy tailness within each state of the Markov switching in order to achieve a minimal risk and a maximum return. The flexibility of R-vine copula allows adequate bivariate copula selection for each pair of cryptocurrencies to achieve suitable dependence structure through pair-copula construction architecture. © 2020, Swiss Society for Financial Market Research.","Differential evolution; Long range dependence; Lévy processes; Portfolio optimization; R-vine copula","","","","","","University of Johannesburg, UJ; Agence des Aires Marines Protégées, AAMP","The authors are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions, which led to significant improvement in the presentation and quality of this paper.

Using daily data from November 2018 to June 2020, we use both DY (Diebold & Yilmaz, 2012) and BK (Baruník et al., 2017) to examine the volatility connectedness of returns series. The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Equity and other prices; Fintech; Fourth industrial revolution; Green bonds; Portfolio diversification","Matthiola incana; Cryptocurrency; Fintech; Frequency domain analysis; Gold; Green manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Transmissions; Daily datum; Financial assets; Hedging instruments; High probability; Industrial revolutions; Shock transmission; Time and frequency domains; Volatility transmissions; automation; currency; equity; innovation; spillover effect; stock market; Financial markets","","","","","","","Abakah E.J.A., Gil-Alana L.A., Madigu G., Romero-Rojo F., Volatility persistence in cryptocurrency markets under structural breaks, International Review of Economics & Finance, (2020); Ahmad W., On the dynamic dependence and investment performance of crude oil and clean energy stocks, Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 376-389, (2017); Ahmed M.S., Alhadab M., Momentum, asymmetric volatility and idiosyncratic risk-momentum relation: does technology-sector matter?, The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, (2020); Baffes J., (2020); Baker S., Bloom N., Davis S.J., Kost K., Sammon M., Viratyosin T., The unprecedented stock market reaction to COVID-19, Covid Economics: Vetted and Real-Time Papers, 1, 3, (2020); Barber S., Boyen X., Shi E., Uzun E., Bitter to better - how to make bitcoin a better currency, Proceedings of the International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, (2012); Barunik J., Kocenda E., Vacha L., 77, pp. 39-56, (2017); Barunik J., Krehlik T., Cyclical properties of supply-side and demand-side shocks in oil-based commodity markets, Energy Econ., 65, pp. 208-218, (2017); Barunik J., Krehlik T., Measuring the frequency dynamics of financial connectedness and systemic risk, Journal of Financial Econometrics, 16, 2, pp. 271-296, (2018); Baur D.G., Dimpfl T., Kuck K., Bitcoin, gold and the US dollar - A replication and extention, Finance Research Letters, 25, pp. 103-110, (2018); Baur D.G., Lucey B.M., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

Considering its emergence in India, it is pertinent to examine the issues associated with the usage of cryptocurrency and the scope it entails for the Indian economy if allowed. The government of India has so far not identified it as valid tender due to its potential usage in hiding black money and in terror financing. However, the government has not necessarily closed the door to any future regulations of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, despite operating in a grey area, the sector continues to proliferate in India and the world. This paper briefly describes the nuances and current affairs related to cryptocurrencies across the globe. It further provides a legal and regulatory perspective of cryptocurrencies in India while also discusses various cybersecurity issues related to its usage and concludes with a list of challenges associated with its incorporation in the national legal regime and tries to provide a certain recommendation that can help guide the future regulation of this disruptive innovation. © 2021, Transition Academia Press.

The setting provides an overarching story with three inter-related taxpayers and a variety of transactions—miner, short-term investor, and long-term investor—thus, allowing instructors to assign individuals or groups to one or more scenarios. There is limited primary authority on virtual currency, leading students to relate the virtual currency transactions to existing primary authority. The case learning objectives are: (1) critical thinking, (2) technical knowledge, (3) tax research proficiency, and (4) written communication skills. Students identify relevant tax-related issues, conduct tax research, and prepare a research memorandum that summarizes their findings. © 2021, American Accounting Association.

I propose distinguishing decentralization, as the dispersion of organizational communications, from distribution, as the dispersion of organizational decision-making. Organizations can be distributed without being decentralized (and vice versa), and having multiple management layers directly affects only distribution – not decentralization. This proposed distinction has implications for understanding the growth of digital platforms (e.g. amazon.com), which dominate the global economy in the 21st century. While prominent platforms typically use machine learning as their core technology to transform inputs (e.g. data) into outputs (e.g. matchmaking services), blockchain has emerged as an alternative technological blueprint. I argue that blockchain enables platforms that are both decentralized and distributed (e.g. Bitcoin), whereas machine learning fosters centralized communications and the concentration of decision-making (e.g. Facebook Inc.). This distinction has crucial implications for antitrust policy, which, I contend, should shift both its analysis and its target of action away from the corporate level and focus instead on the data level. Based on this essay’s framework, I make several predictions regarding the future of competition between centralized and decentralized platforms, the evolution of government regulation, and broader implications for managers in the digital economy and for the business schools charged with their education. I conclude with reflections on the opportunity to revive cybernetic thinking for preventing a dystopian future dominated by a handful of platform behemoths. © The Author(s) 2020.","antitrust; blockchain; decentralized; distributed; machine learning; platform; trust","","","","","","","","Abend G., Making things possible, Sociological Methods & Research, (2020); Acemoglu D., Makhdoumi A., Malekian A., Ozdaglar A., Too much data: Prices and inefficiencies in data markets, NBER, (2020); Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A., Prediction machines: The simple economics of artificial intelligence, (2018); Ahmed N., Technological discontinuities and R&D collaboration strategies: How deep learning changed firm-level collaboration strategies in artificial intelligence, Working paper, (2020); Ahn J., Vergne J.-P., Yuser: Funding startup growth with token issuance?, (2020); Antonopoulos A., the fourth be with you, (2020); Baran P., On distributed communications.

Bitcoin is interpreted as a foreign currency in a small open economy where money supply and aggregate dividend are exogenous. The equilibrium bitcoin prices increase with diffusive and jump risks of these two exogenous factors. Analytical option pricing formulas are obtained with Merton's model as a special case. Static analysis reveals that a bitcoin call (put) option value increases (decreases) with the money supply growth rate. Numerical analysis shows that all risks lead to a positive premium in option prices relative to the Black–Scholes model. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","bitcoin options; equilibrium valuation; systematic and nonsystematic jump risk premiums","","","","","","Schulich School of Business","We thank an anonymous referee and the Editor, Bob Webb for their constructive comments and suggestions.

In 2009, the first open-source Blockchain-based cyber currency was introduced as Bitcoin. By 2025, studies indicate that Blockchain-based enterprise-wide application revenue will reach nearly $20 billion. Therefore, this study proposes to build on the success of Thailand’s National Single Window (THAINSW) gateway document interchange architecture (DIA) and further expand its availability to a much larger network of e-Government participants using Blockchain architecture. Therefore, the authors set how to investigate how and where Blockchain technology could be implemented in order to support of Thailand’s 4.0 and digital economy visions. In addition to the qualitative analysis of the literature, the authors used input from a panel of 25 Thai experts to develop a foundation for the analysis based on Sathosi Nakamoto’s seven Blockchain disciplines. This analysis was enhanced from the authors’ own experiences in real-world Blockchain implementations. Results revealed that Blockchain is a highly innovative approach to secure transaction execution, information storage, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open architectural environment. Blockchain has the potential to increase good governance, increase transparency and privacy, and reduce the chance of corruption. © 2021.

In a standard European-wide real estate transaction, several intermediaries are involved. As a consequence, these agreements are usually time-consuming and involve extra difficulties to cross-border operations. As blockchain, combined with smart contracts, may have an important role in these transactions, this paper aims to explore its prospective challenges, limitations and opportunities in the real estate sector and discover how the traditional intermediaries have to face a possible implementation of this technology. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses the current intermediaries in the real estate sector in European Union (EU), their functions and how can blockchain strengthen the security of these transactions while reducing their time. The author uses a legal methodology to approach it. Findings: Blockchain, combined with smart contracts, has both challenges and opportunities for the real estate sector. On the one hand, it may improve procedures, allow EU transactions and the interconnection between public administration. However, to not reduce parties rights, this blockchain should have some special features, such as the possibility of being amended. Originality/value: This paper provides a valuable overview of all the intermediaries that could be affected by blockchain protocols. It is of interest of blockchain developers, public administrations and researchers who are working on blockchain and property conveyancing. © 2020, Rosa M.

Findings: Instead of banning trade and other transactions using BTC and other cryptocurrencies, financial experts, with the able assistance of IT and mining experts, from all over the world need to convene and tailor an effective regulatory framework. Solid cooperation among the international community, supported by unitary standards and procedures, will help boost the worlds AML/combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) efforts. As an added bonus, effective regulation, monitoring and control can facilitate more efficient tax collection.

However, there was a low acceptance of these technologies among consumers. There is a clear gap in-between that has not yet been taken into consideration and has been misunderstood on many platforms. This paper intends to estimate the usability of blockchain technology by investigating behavioral elements that affect customers' intention towards blockchain-based cryptocurrency transactions. Given the complexity of the technology, this study proposes a new integration model: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) together with new external variables regarding blockchain adoption characteristics such as trust, regulatory support, social influence, design, and experience. Surveys were conducted among international users to identify the impacts of these variables on their intention. Our findings indicate two powerful constructs (regulatory support and experience) that encourage customer trust towards blockchain-based applications. People surveyed agreed on a great sense of security and can trust the Blockchain-based applications when they are regulated and insured by the local government. Also, at a certain level of experience, users feel confident to use blockchain-based applications, a high level of trust supports technology adoption. As such, governments and businesses can dedicate efforts to enhance customers' trust and ultimately promote better acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications. © 2020","And design; Behavioral intention; Blockchain; Experience; Regulatory support; Social influence; TAM; Trust","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Sales; Surveys; User experience; Customer perspectives; Financial transactions; Integration models; Local government; Regulatory support; Sense of security; Technology acceptance model; Technology adoption; complexity; currency market; electronic commerce; financial market; financial system; global economy; technology adoption; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Zhonggen Y., Xiaozhi Y., An extended technology acceptance model of a mobile learning technology, Comput.

Moreover, an empirical investigation takes place in order to find the impact that TPU exerts on Bitcoin market values by employing a spectrum of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) specifications. Existing studies support that trade policy uncertainty leads to lower-quality and more expensive products and weak participation in international trade. Moreover, it contributes to lower democratic sentiment, hesitant internal migration and lesser socio-economic mobility and higher fluctuations in profitable assets. Moreover, our econometric findings reveal that TPU positively affects Bitcoin prices while crude oil values negatively influence this major cryptocurrency. Thereby, higher trade policy uncertainty is found to increase demand and favorite investments into risky assets in order to ameliorate the risk-return trade-off in investors’ portfolios. This study provides a compass for investing during turmoil due to trade wars and tariffs. © 2021 by the author.","Bitcoin; financial markets; macro economy; survey; trade policy uncertainty","","","","","","","","Ahir H., Bloom N., Furceri D., The World Uncertainty Index, (2018); Akaike H., A new look at the statistical model identification, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, pp. 716-723, (1974); Altomonte C., Aquilante T., The EU-EFIGE/Bruegel-Unicredit Dataset (No. 2012/13), (2012); Baier S.L., Bergstrand J.H., Economic determinants of free trade agreements, Journal of international Economics, 64, pp. 29-63, (2004); Baur D.G., Dimpfl T., Kuck K., Bitcoin, gold and the US dollar—A replication and extension, Finance Research Letters, 25, pp. 103-110, (2018); Ben-David D., Equalizing exchange: Trade liberalization and income convergence, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108, pp. 653-679, (1993); Bhagwati J., Ramaswami V.K., Domestic distortions, tariffs and the theory of optimum subsidy, Journal of Political Economy, 71, pp. 44-50, (1963); Blundell R., Bond S., Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 87, pp. 115-143, (1998); Bollerslev T., Glossary to ARCH (GARCH), Volatility and Time Series Econometrics Essays in Honor of Robert Engle.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum markets are studied due to the level of electricity demand for active trading and mining in the three leading crypto mining economies (United States, China, and Japan). Among other findings, the leading net transmitter of information is the return of the Bitcoin market while the demand for electricity in the U.S. and Japan are the leading net information receivers in the ECN system. In a nutshell, the return and trading volumes of the cryptocurrency markets are net information transmitters while the markets' volatility and the demand for electricity in the U.S., China, and Japan are net information receivers in the system. As a policy relevance, given the favourable developments in these crypto markets, greener sources of electrical energy are expedient to mitigate emissions while mining these coins. This will reduce the impact of human activities on the climate. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","connectedness; cryptocurrency; electricity; return; spillover; volatility","China; Japan; United States;

The data becomes very huge in each organization which led to the emergence of the new concept called Big Data. Big Data creates a valuable chance for companies to maximize their outcomes by analyzing this type of data. However, there is a concern regarding user privacy in the centralized systems as they have limited control over their personal stored information and how to use it. Added to that is the need for third-party availability which is considered another security issue. Recently, new accountable systems have emerged called Bitcoin. The world started using blockchain technology by deploying the first application namely bitcoin. It is a digital currency used for trading things over the web like money in the real world. Due to the success of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has gained trust from users as it is used in various fields and services, for example, monetary institutions, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain, election, medicinal handling, and stockpiling. The main idea of the blockchain is to establish distributed agreement in the digital online world. It opens a great opportunity for the digital economy to be more scalable than the current centralized one. There are huge wonderful features and chances upcoming with this novel technology, and the uprising in this area has just commenced. Due to the importance of this technology, this paper aims to assess the current status of implementing blockchain technology in Oman. The statistical results clearly show the weak implementation of this technology in Oman's sectors. © 2021 University of Bahrain.

We identify that all the seven marketplaces use the same software to manage Bitcoin by investigating transactions in these marketplaces. However, the software was no longer used since May 2016 because of its vulnerability to protect anonymity. It indicates that dark web marketplaces advanced to the next stage with anonymity-enhancing tools around in March 2016. Using simple heuristics to identify and trace Bitcoin addresses associated with these marketplaces, purchases on these marketplaces are identified and evaluated. Our method provides evidence on market size, development, and fluctuation over time to fill a gap in previous studies. Dark web marketplaces continue to thrive because users migrate to new marketplaces after the existing ones are shut down. The total sales volume on Silk Road was 192.7 million US dollars between June 2012 and October 2013. The corresponding figures for Silk Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution, Nucleus, and Abraxas were 112.9, 220.7, 69.7, 88.3, and 35.6 million US dollars, respectively.

Blockchain seeks to improve information security and transparency by sharing encrypted data among peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Due to its emphasis on security and trust, there is increased demand for blockchain's application in a variety of business sectors. The decentralized nature of blockchain creates the new concept of a token economy in which the community's revenue can be allocated to the actual content producers and service users who create value. This article looks at how blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are evolving and interconnected, creating a token economy through different business models. Blockchain is expected to be a key technology that enables new protocols for the establishment of a token economy in the future, leading to a new economic paradigm. © 2019 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Decentralization; ICO; Token economy","","","","","","","","Aras S.T., Kulkarni V., Blockchain and its applications – a detailed survey, International Journal of Computer Application, 180, 3, pp. 29-35, (2017); Basden J., Cottrell M., How utilities are using blockchain to modernize the grid, Harvard Business Review, (2017); Bohme R., Christin N., Edelman B., Moore T., Bitcoin: Economics, technology, and governance, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29, 2, pp. 213-238, (2015); Buterin V., A next generation smart contract and decentralized application platform [White Paper], Ethereum, (2014); Cachin C., Architecture of the hyperledger blockchain fabric, (2016); Catalini C., Gans J.S., Some simple economics of the blockchain [Working Paper No. 22952], National Bureau of Economic Research, (2018); Chatsko M., Can Cardano replace bitcoin and Ethereum?

However, this technology can be practically applied in many areas of the national economy, including oil and gas industry. For example, the blockchain can be useful in solving problems related to the confirming the integrity of primary geological and geophysical data during remote monitoring of the well construction process by excluding the influence of human factor. This technology is referred to as the industrial blockchain and requires consistent encryption and data distribution on storage locations in peer-to-peer network. Any modification of the primary geological and geophysical data in the blockchain system, on any of the computers/equipment in any block, will automatically detected by all participants of the blockchain network. The system of ensuring the integrity and invariability of the received and transmitted data will work as long as at least a single of the network is operated. Hacking such a system is not feasible and cost-effective because the potential attackers have to break through every block, as well as copies of the database on every computer and equipment in the network. This requires a potential attacker to have unique computing resources, which is currently not available. In practice, the reliability of blockchain platforms is confirmed by many years of experience in the bitcoin mining system based on the blockchain principles. The implementation of the blockchain platform in the oil and gas service allowed to ensure and guarantee the reliability of primary geological and geophysical data obtained from wells in real time, to reduce the risks of unauthorized changes. The reliability of the primary data reduces the risks of erroneous management decisions, made by the processing and analysis of these primary well data. © 2018, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: Whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: Governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform. © 2016, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

It has created a platform for tremendous financial innovation, but at the same time the role of traditional regulatable financial intermediaries is bypassed. The purpose of this article is to address the important policy question of how we can capture Bitcoin’s potential benefits for the economy while addressing new regulatory challenges. To do so, we first conceptualise the Bitcoin ecosystem through the layered model of internet architecture. Second, we apply the layers principle of internet governance to identify control points and guidelines for regulation that respect the integrity of the layers. Third, we conclude with the need for governments to adopt an adaptive and novel regulatory approach to ensure that society can benefit from Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential. This work forms a baseline for further understanding of the governance of Bitcoin and the various actors within the ecosystem based on the layers principle of internet architecture. © 2014, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

Electronic money covers the payment cards with magnetic tape, chip cards, the contact-less payments by card, mobile phone, or tablet PC, and the logical moneys (often called ‘virtual moneys’ such as the Bitcoin, the Litecoin, the PPCoin, the Ven, the Linden dollar, the ‘gold’ as in the digital game World of Warcraft). These forms of electronic moneys have three common properties: the cryptography, the network, and the privileges. Cryptography conditions the ways to access the money. The network represents the kind of regulation of electronic moneys. The privileges differentiate the use of electronic moneys. Each form of electronic money does not match these three conditions identically because all are not equipped with the same technologies and the same related services. Nevertheless, the presence of these three properties within all forms of electronic money leads to a better understanding of how such functionalized money deeply changes our view on modern society. Indeed, whereas the economic standard model considers money as a veil hiding economic reality, the case of electronic money lets us think, on the contrary, since the swell period of the early 1970s, of the real economy as veiling socio-economic reality, which has to be considered as a kind of a Ponzi scheme. While this scheme becomes the core of societal reality, the economic laws and their sociological as well as political equivalents, functional differentiation, and democracy are no longer the pillars of modernity. They hide this reality as fetishes enabling its order. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Cryptography; Electronic money; Functionalization; Modernity; Network; Ponzi scheme; Privileges","","","","","","","","Adyen’s Inaugural Global Mobile Payments Index Reveals Worldwide Mobile Payments Transaction Growth of 75% over past 10 Months, (2013); Agarwal S., Chomsisengphet S., Liu C.L., Consumer bankruptcy and default: The role of individual social capital, Journal of Economic Psychology, 32, 4, pp. 632-650, (2011); Anderson A., Cannell D., Gibbons T., Grote G., Henn J., Kennedy J., Muir M., Potter N., Whitby R., An Electronic Cash and Credit System, (1966); Politique, (1974); Barr A., Exclusive: Google Leans on Developers to Use Payment Service, (2012); Benson C.C., Loftesness S., Payments Systems in the U.S. Menlo Park: Glenbrook Partners, (2010); Bergstra J., De Leeuw K., Bitcoin and Beyond: Exclusively Informational Money, (2013); Boot A.W.A., Ratnovski L., Banking and trading, IMF Working Paper, 12, 238, (2012); Subprime Lending is a Drain on Home Ownership, (2007); Dahrendorf R., Der moderne soziale Konflikt, Essay Zur Politik Der Freiheit, (1992); Deutschmann C., Die Verheißung des absoluten Reichtums, Zur religiösen Natur Des Kapitalismus, (1999); Dickstein C., Thomas H., Subprime and Predatory Lending in Rural America: Mortgage Lending Practices that Can Trap Low-Income Rural People, (2006); Dunn L., Kim T., Empirical Investigation of Credit Card Default, (1999); Ekici T., Dunn L., Credit card debt and consumption: Evidence from household-level data, Applied Economics, 42, 4, pp. 455-462, (2010); The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA): An Integrated Retail Payments Market, (2006); Virtual Currency Schemes.

The theoretical interpretation of the process of cryptocurrencies occurrence in the context of definitions of electronic funds and virtual payment services is carried out. Cryptocurrencies show impressive dynamics of growth, but this is due to the rapidly growing public interest, which provokes demand in the market and limits supply. The study clarifies the growth factors of the cryptocurrency, gives an assessment of the prospects and forecasts various scenarios for the cryptocurrency system development. In the course of the correlationregression analysis of the Bitcoin price dynamics, it is determined that the observations approximations best correspond to the polynomial model of the third degree and the exponential model. For both of them, the determination coefficient is close to the boundaries of the confidence interval. Based on the analysis of the Bitcoin market price dynamics, it is concluded that the demand for cryptocurrency has been formed not by its intrinsic value, but by market expectations, as well as by the level of interest and involvement of participants in this virtual network (via network effect). Based on the example of the financial market, it is shown that the possibilities of blockchain technology are versatile. The prospects for its development are determined by the needs of decentralization in order to improve the sustainability and security of business processes. © 2018.","Blockchain technology; Crypto-currencies; Digital economy; Financial markets; Means of payment","","","","","","","","Belomyttseva O.S., On the Concept of Bitcoin Cryptocurrency within the Context of Financial Regulators and Private Electronic Currency, Problems of Accounting and Finance, 2, 14, pp. 26-29, (2014); Virtual Currency Schemes, (2012); Virtual Currency Schemes-a Further Analysis.

On the one side, there are payment platforms such as AliPay, PayPal and AribaPay; on the other, there are token-based solutions such as Bitcoin. Announced in June 2019, Facebook’s Libra initiative represents a culmination of these novel approaches. This paper will review the current alternatives for international payments and the drivers behind these developments. The paper adopts a taxonomy to characterise money in the digital age and extends this in order to compare the different solutions. Three main dimensions can be applied to distinguish the concepts: tokens versus accounts; proprietary/closed-loop versus interopera-ble; and settlement-based versus messages between local pools. While no current alternative could completely replace the existing system for the time being, close monitoring of the way forward and more research will be needed to derive more insight into this complex challenge. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Centralised platforms; Correspondent banking; International payments; Libra; Token economy","","","","","","","","Holden H., New Correspondent Banking Data — the Decline Continues, (2019); Digiacomo N., Denecker O., Holl R., Niederkorn M., Meurant L., Newman H., Raymaekers W., A vision for the future of cross-border payments, Mckinsey & Company and SWIFT, (2019); Cross-Border Retail Payments, (2018); Cross-Border Interbank Payments and Settlements: Emerging Opportunities for Digital Transformation, (2018); Zhao X., Zhang H., Rutter K., Thompson C., Wan C., Cross-Border Settlement Systems: Blockchain Models Involving Central Bank Money, (2018); Jasper-Ubin Design Paper: Enabling Cross-Border High-Value Transfer Using Distributed Ledger Technologies, (2019); Cash on Trial, (2019); Williamson O.E., The economics of organization: The transaction cost approach, American Journal of Sociology, 87, 3, pp. 548-577, (1981); Kosten für Auslandsüberweisungen steigen deutlich, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, (2019); Transfermate Announces Strategic Relationship with Wells Fargo, (2019); ING Investment Simplifies International Payments, (2018); Crypto-Assets: Implications for Financial Stability, Monetary Policy, and Payments and Market Infrastructures, (2019); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Fischer M.F., Lynch N.A., Paterson M.S., Impossibility of distributed consensus, Journal of the ACM, 32, 2, pp. 374-382, (1985); Decker C., Seidel J., Wattenhofer R., Bitcoin meets strong consistency’, ‘Proceedings of the 17Th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking, Singapore, 4th–7th January, (2016); Scheck J., Shifflett S., How dirty money disappears into the black hole of cryptocurrency, Wall Street Journal, (2018); Carstens A., Money in the Digital Age: What Role for Central banks?’, Paper Presented at Goethe University, Frankfurt, (2018); Irrera A., Visa looks to speed up cross-border payments with new network launch, Reuters, (2019); Decker C., Wattenhofer R., A fast and scalable payment network with bitcoin duplex micropayment channels, Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems, pp. 3-18, (2015); Poon J., Dryja T., The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments, (2016); Dziembowski S., Eckey L., Fausty S., Malinowski D., Perun: Virtual Payment Hubs over Cryptocurrencies, (2018); Utility Settlement Coin (USC) Continues to Evolve, (2019); P27 — Building the Pan-Nordic Payment Infrastructure — Update Q2 2019, (2019); Crosman P., Is This Swifts Answer to Ripple?’, American Banker, (2019); ‘SWIFT Trials Instant Cross-Border Gpi Payments through TIPS, (2019); Future of Payments, (2019); World’s First E-Money License for Blockchains Issued to Monerium, (2019); Marcus D., Libra’s mission’, (2019); An Introduction to Libra, (2019); BoE’s Carney Says Keeping Open Mind on Facebook’s Libra, (2019); Bruno Le Maire découvre La Libra De Facebook (Et Il n’aime Pas Trop ça), (2019); Rep.

The main question in the debate seems to be, is bitcoin valued in direct use? The present paper contends that with respect to the regression theorem, this issue has no bearing on bitcoin’s genesis, because it is relevant only when a new medium of exchange arises out of a pure barter economy. The debate is therefore predicated on a misinter pretation of the theorem. However, the issue of bitcoin’s direct-use value, if it has one, does have relevance in assessing the likelihood it will become a generally-accepted medium of exchange—i.e. money. © 2015, Ludwig Von Mises Institute.

With blockchain, individual cryptographic identity becomes the basis for new forms of money and for a whole suite of restructured social, political and financial transactions. But what do these developments signal for feminist engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a ‘feminist weapon’. But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered, racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend representations of gold along with the ‘metallism’ surrounding blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of fundamental value returns, together with related associations of essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background for the ‘new libertarianism’ whose ascendency now overshadows the neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some decades. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; decentralisation; gold; gold standard; libertarianism","","","","","","","","Adkins L., What Can Money Do?

Although Bitcoin does present several forward- looking innovations, it also integrates a very old concept into its digital architecture: the mining of precious metals. Even though Bitcoin explicitly invokes mining as a metaphor and gold as an example for understanding the cryptocurrency, there has been little critical work on the connections between Bitcoin and previous metalist currency regimes. The following essay proposes a historical comparison with colonial South American silver mining and the global currency regime based on the New World silver peso it created as a way to interrogate Bitcoin. The comparison with colonial South America, and specifically the silver mining economy around the Cerro Rico de Potosí, will help to develop a historical and political understanding of Bitcoin’s stakes, including questions of resources, labor, energy, and ecology. Mining and the extractive apparatus that accompanies it always imply massive- scale earthworks that reshape the planet itself, a process known as terraforming. The Potosí comparison will reveal Bitcoin to form part of a similar process of digital primitive accumulation we can provisionally name cryptoforming. ©2017 by the Society for the History of Technology.

Now much of the discussion revolves around the attributes that determine its many potential applications as this technology is expected to help transform sectors that are hampered by inefficiencies as well as facilitate the appearance of new business models based on distributed markets and technology. Given this technological revolution has already started, the core objectives of this article are to acquaint the reader with the technology and with the current and latent applications of this innovation while recognising its potential worldwide economic impact. To accomplish these goals we review the literature encompassing both academic and professional works that refer to the characteristics and properties of the blockchain, its many existent and plausible applications, and the reasons for its anticipated global economic repercussions.

Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Code/space; Disruption; Financial technologies; Fintech; Innovation","algorithm; complexity; currency; database; finance; innovation; valuation","","","","","","","Amoore L., Data derivatives: on the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times, Theory, Culture Soc., 28, 6, pp. 24-43, (2011); Amoore L., Raley R., pp. 1-8, (2016); Angel J., (2014); Bearman S., (2017); Berndt C., Boeckler M., Geographies of markets: materials, morals and monsters in motion, Prog.

The researcher discusses the payment system to understand if Bitcoin would replace our cash-based society. The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © Jarunee Wonglimpiyarat, 2016.","Bitcoin; Cashless; Darwinism; Digital money; Payment system","","","","","","","","Miles I., Services in the new industrial economy, Futures, 25, pp. 653-672, (1993); Miles I., Innovation in services, Handbook of Industrial Innovations, (1994); Miles I., Knowledge Intensive Services' Suppliers and Clients, Ministry of Trade and Industry Finland Studies and Reports, (2003); Miles I., Innovation in Service, Handbook of Innovation, (2005); Utterback J., Abernathy W., A Dynamic Model of Process and Product Innovation, Omega, 3, pp. 639-656, (1975); Vernon R., International Investment and International Trade in the Product Cycle, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 80, pp. 190-207, (1966); Fisher J.C., Pry R.H., A Simple Substitution Model of Technological Change, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 3, pp. 75-88, (1971); Abernathy W.J., Clark K.B., Kantrow A.M., Industrial Renaissance: Producing a Competitive Future for America, (1983); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovations, (1962); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovations, (1995); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovations, (2003); Schumpeter J.A., Business cycles: A Theoretical, Historical and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process, (1939); Schumpeter J.A., The Theory of Economic Development, (1967); Rosenberg N., The directions of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices, Perspectives on Technology, (1976); Rosenberg N., Learning by Using, Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics, (1982); Nelson R., Winter S., In Search of a Useful Theory of Innovation, Research Policy, 6, pp. 36-76, (1977); Nelson R., Winter S., An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, (1982); Dosi G., Technological Paradigms and Technological Trajectories, Research Policy, 11, pp. 146-162, (1982); Pavitt K., The Management of Strategic Change, Commentary on Chapter 3, (1986); Pavitt K., Strategic Management in the Innovating Firm, Frontiers of Management, (1989); Kuhn T.S., The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, (1970); Tushman M., Erson P., Technological discontinuities and organization environments, The Management of Strategic Change, (1987); Abernathy W.J., Clark K.B., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction, Research Policy, 14, pp. 3-22, (1985); Gallouj F., Weinstein O., Innovation in services, Research Policy, 26, pp. 537-556, (1997); Freeman C., Perez C., Structural Crises of Adjustment, Business Cycles and Investment Behavior, (1988); Eisenhardt K.M., Building Theories from Case Study research, Academy of Management Review14, pp. 532-550, (1989); Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (2013); Gort M., Klepper S., Time paths in the diffusion of product innovations, The Economic Journal, 92, pp. 630-653, (1982); Cooper R., Kleinschmidt E., New Products: The Key Factors in Success, (1990); Peres R., Muller E., Mahajan V., Innovation Diffusion and New Product Growth Models: A Critical Review and Research Directions, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 27, pp. 91-106, (2010); Guseo R., Guidolin M., Heterogeneity in Diffusion of Innovations Modelling: A Few Fundamental Types, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 90, pp. 366-378, (2015)","J.

New business models and regulatory environments disrupt more traditional fee-based strategies, and new entrants seek to displace legacy players by leveraging new mobile platforms and new sources of data. In this increasingly diversified industry landscape, start-ups and established players are attempting to embed payment in ‘social’ experience through novel technologies of accounting for trust. This imagination of the social, however, is being materialized in gated platforms for payment, accounting, and exchange. This paper explores the ambiguous politics of such experiments, specifically those, like Bitcoin or the on-demand sharing economy, that delineate an economic imaginary of ‘just us’ – a closed and closely guarded community of peers operating under the illusion that there are no mediating institutions undergirding that community. This provokes questions about the intersection of payment and publics. Payment innovators’ attenuated understanding of the social may, we suggest, evacuate the nitty-gritty of politics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Bitcoin; money; payments; public; the sharing economy; the social","","","","","","Filene Research Institute; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; National Science Foundation, NSF, (SES 0960423, 1455859, 1455859, 0960423)","Although we write as a collective, we wish to acknowledge that Nelms took the lead in producing this article.

This paper indicates their pros and cons as alternatives to “real” money and explains their appearance as the reflection of the present trends. It also presents the possible scenarios of their development. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on the former foresight research results and literature review. It highlights the main trends in contemporary economy and their impact on financial services. The Bitcoin case is the starting point for the virtual currencies’ market analysis and construction of possible market changes scenarios. Findings – Virtual currency schemes are the reflection of present trends. They are just ahead of our times but may become a common means of payment, changing the way of providing financial services, eliminating intermediaries and marginalizing the role of financial institutions. Research limitations/implications – The multiplicity of virtual currencies and ceaseless introduction of innovations impede the presentation of the complete market picture. The lack of reliable statistical data makes the estimation of the market growth difficult. Practical implications – This paper indicates influence of technology development, virtualization and networking on payment systems’ functioning. Social implications – This paper shows the impact of environmental changes on consumers’ acceptance of virtual currencies. Originality/value – The virtual currency as a payment system is quite new and still a marginalized phenomenon. Nevertheless, the pace of virtual currency market growth after its recent introduction and appearance of Bitcoin successors seems to be the signs of future changes in financial service sector. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Financial services; Forecasting; Information society; Internet; Scenario planning","","","","","","","","Anderson C.H., Free: How Today's Smartest Businesses Profit by Giving Something for Nothing, pp. 165-237, (2010); Aron J., Virtual economy looms as digital cash grows up, pp. 22-23, (2012); Bank for International Settlements, Core Principles for Systematically Important Payment Systems, pp. 6-10, (2001); Bank for International Settlements, Innovations in Retail Payments: Report of the Working Group on Innovations in Retail Payments, pp. 57-58, (2012); Borak D., Yellen: Fed doesn't have authority to regulate Bitcoin, American Banker, 179, F309, (2013); Bustillos M., The bitcoin boom, (2013); Economist Intelligence Unit, Foresight 2020, economic, industry and corporate trends report, pp. 3-4, (2006); European Central Bank, Virtual Currency Schemes, October 2012, (2012); Finweek, Money 101: Understanding cryptocurrencies, (2013); FORESEC, Foresec final report, cooperation in the context of complexity: European security in light of evolving trends, drivers, and threats, (2009); Government Office for Science, Department of business innovations and skills, (2012); Grant R.M., Contemporary Strategic Analysis, pp. 311-315, (2009); Greengard S., Digitally possessed, Communications of the ACM, 55, 5, (2012); Grossman L., Mad money, (2013); Hall M., Bitcoin: Change you can believe in?, pp. 10-14, (2013); Johnson A.R., Money transfers in bitcoins?

Blockchain has the potentials in providing security for transactions between several inventive commercial trading, government, healthcare, payments, and other critical applications, however they still have to deal with a security weakness on their fresh important infringement of exchanges. Thus the major security issues left behind are needed to be control before blockchain acquire the mainstream.

On the other hand, considering the flexibility, economy and reprogrammable or reconfigurable hardware design, FPGAs are being proposed for various hardware realizations of algorithms. The paper is on the advancement of blockchain technology enhancing the scalability and reliability of the HSM by employing it with FPGA. Bringing in the idea of PUF into the chip along with the Blockchain technology to secure and store its encryption or private keys, its security level can be enhanced.

The paper focuses on findings of comparative analysis of consumer value of precious metals, cash and non-cash money and cryptocurrencies as different forms of money. The authors provide comprehensive descriptions and expert quantitative estimates for each of the listed forms of money, as well as determine the place of cryptocurrency in the modern financial system as a means of payment. The research presents a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of new technologies. The paper defines the status of cryptocurrencies in various countries of the world and names promising development trends. The authors determine the main obstacles hindering the circulation of cryptocurrencies in certain markets and assess the risks and prospects associated with the introduction and use of cryptocurrencies as a new form of money which aims at full/partial replacement of fiat money in the modern financial system. As a conclusion it is noted that weak integration into the financial system is the main obstacle to major distribution of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

The objective is to develop insights into the evolution of the Bitcoin economy during this period. For this, we establish and analyze a novel integrated dataset that enriches data from the Bitcoin blockchain with off-network data such as business categories and geo-locations. Our analyses reveal the major Bitcoin businesses and markets. Our results also give insights on the business distribution by countries and how businesses evolve over time. We also show that there is a gambling network that features many very small transactions. Furthermore, regional differences in the adoption and business distribution could be found. In the network analysis, the small world phenomenon is investigated and confirmed for several subgraphs of the Bitcoin network. © 2016 by the authors.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Complex networks; Cryptocurrencies; Electronic payment; Graph analysis; Network analysis","Complex networks; Economics; Electric network analysis; Bitcoin; Block-chain; Electronic payment; Geolocations; Graph analysis; Network data; Regional differences; Small World Phenomenon; Electronic money","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Reid F., Harrigan M., An Analysis of Anonymity in the Bitcoin System, In Security and Privacy in Social Networks, pp. 197-223, (2012); The Economist: Bitcoins; Baumann A., Fabian B., Lischke M., Exploring the Bitcoin Network, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST), (2014); Drainville D., An Analysis of the Bitcoin Electronic Cash System, (2012); Ober M., Katzenbeisser S., Hamacher K., Structure and Anonymity of the Bitcoin Transaction Graph, Future Internet, 5, pp. 237-250, (2013); (2016); Meiklejohn S., Pomarole M., Jordan G., Levchenko K., McCoy D., Voelker G.M., Savage S., A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names, Proceedings of the 2013 Internet Measurement Conference, pp. 127-140, (2013); Spagnuolo M., BitIodine: Extracting Intelligence from the Bitcoin Network, (2013); Androulaki E., Karame G.O., Roeschlin M., Scherer T., Capkun S., Evaluating User Privacy in Bitcoin, In Financial Cryptography and Data Security, 7859, pp. 34-51, (2013); Kaminsky D., Black Ops of TCP/IP, Presentation, Black Hat & Chaos Communication Camp 2011, (2016); Ortega M., The Bitcoin Transaction Graph Anonymity, (2013); (2016); (2016); Brugere I., Bitcoin Transaction Network Dataset.

To date, sustainability literature has treated knowledge—and in particular digital artifacts—mainly as a means to the end of achieving sustainable development. In this conceptual paper, we argue that digital artifacts themselves ought also to be considered as resources, which also need to be sustainable. While over-consumption is a problem facing natural resources, with sustainable digital artifacts, underproduction, and underuse are the biggest challenges. In our view, the sustainability of digital artifacts improves their potential impact on sustainable development. A theoretical foundation for digital artifacts and their ecosystem allows us to present the relevant research on digital information, knowledge management, digital goods, and innovation literature. Based on these insights, we propose ten basic conditions for sustainable digital artifacts and their ecosystem to ensure that they provide the greatest possible benefit for sustainable development. We then apply those characteristics to four exemplary cases: Linux kernel development, Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the Wikipedia project, and the Linking Open Drug Data repositories. The paper concludes with a research agenda identifying topics for sustainability scholars and information systems academics, as well as practitioners. A number of suggestions for future studies on digital sustainability are also put forward. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; Digital sustainability; Knowledge commons; Linked Open Data; Linux; Sustainable development; Wikipedia","","","","","","","","Arrow K., Economic welfare and the allocation of resources for invention, The rate and direction of inventive activity: economic and social factors, pp. 609-626, (1962); Baars A., Jansen S., A framework for software ecosystem governance, Software business, pp. 168-180, (2012); Baldwin C.Y., Clark K.B., The architecture of participation: does code architecture mitigate free riding in the open source development model?, Manag Sci, 52, pp. 1116-1127, (2006); Banker R.D., Davis G.B., Slaughter S.A., Software development practices, software complexity, and software maintenance performance: a field study, Manag Sci, 44, pp. 433-450, (1998); Baran P., On distributed communications networks, IEEE Trans Commun Syst, 12, pp. 1-9, (1964); Belleflamme P., Lambert T., Schwienbacher A., Crowdfunding: tapping the right crowd, J Bus Ventur, 29, pp. 585-609, (2014); Benkler Y., Coase’s Penguin, or, Linux and “The Nature of the Firm, Yale Law J, 112, pp. 369-446, (2002); Benkler Y., The wealth of networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom, (2006); Benkler Y., Commons and growth: the essential role of open commons in market economies, (2013); Benkler Y., Shaw A., Hill B.M., Peer production: a form of collective intelligence, Handbook of Collective Intelligence, (2015); Blanchette J.-F., A material history of bits, J Am Soc Inform Sci Technol, 62, pp. 1042-1057, (2011); Bosch J., From software product lines to software ecosystems.

The currency of the papers is a thing of the past, since the virtual currencies are beginning to take control and Bitcoin is ready to achieve this performance. Not only does it revolutionize the way it is paid, but it also potentially affects the USD as the USD, which is already a challenge for the challenges of the EURO or the Chinese Renminbi Yuan (CNY). The increase in crypto currencies will give a new dimension to this challenge for the Ringgit (MYR) in Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to understand the many factors that are gaining momentum in Bitcoin (BTC) in several areas of global finance and how confusing it can be, including the financial system of the major fiduciary currencies, which is mainly MYRs. The most important variables examined are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Technology, Bitcoin Economy and Bitcoin as currency. Furthermore, the study would propose a framework that would become the foundation for the furthering of upcoming explorations. Finally, this study would act as a stepping ground for making effective contributions towards understanding the best possible way to plan for the success of retail market in Malaysia. © ExcelingTech Pub.","Bitcoin; Crypto-currencies; Payment systems; Virtual currency","","","","","","","","Hensler J., Ringle C.M., Sinkovics R.R., New Challenges to International Marketing Advances in International Marketing, 20, pp. 277-319, (2009); Henseler J., Hubona G., Ray P.A., Using PLS path modeling in new technology research: Updated guidelines, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 116, 1, pp. 2-20, (2015); Bhalla S.S., Euro and the Yuan: Different peas in the same pod, Comparative Economic Studies, 53, 3, pp. 355-381, (2011); Hokroh M.A., Examining the Chinese Exchange Rate Reform and the Possibility of the Chinese Yuan Becoming a Regional Trade Currency, Research in Applied Economics, 5, 3, (2013); Chance G., Will The People's Currency Become The Global Currency?, Corporate Finance Review, 19, 3, (2014); Beck R., Avital M., Rossi M., Thatcher J.B., Blockchain Technology in Business and Information Systems Research, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 59, 1, pp. 381-384, (2017); Notheisen B., Cholewa J.B., Shanmugam A.P., Trading Real-World Assets on Blockchain, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 59, 1, pp. 425-440, (2017); Beck R., Stenum Czepluch J., Lollike N., Malone S., Blockchain-The Gateway to trust-free cryptographic transactions, (2016); Risius M., Spohrer K., A Blockchain Research Framework, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 59, 6, pp. 385-409, (2017); Henderson A.R., The bootstrap: A technique for data-driven statistics, Using computer-intensive analyses to explore experimental data, 359, 1, pp. 1-26, (2005); Fisher R.A., Statistical methods for research workers, (1925); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., Trustworthiness in mHealth information services: An assessment of a hierarchical model with mediating and moderating effects using partial least squares (PLS), Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62, 1, pp. 100-116, (2011); Amato S., Esposito Vinzi V., Tenenhaus M., A global goodness-of-fit index for PLS structural equation modeling.

The researcher discusses the payment system to understand if Bitcoin would replace our cash-based society. The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © 2015 Wonglimpiyarat J.","Bitcoin; Cashless; Darwinism; Digital money; Payment system","","","","","","","","Miles I., Services in the new industrial economy, Futures, 25, pp. 653-672, (1993); Miles I., Innovation in services, Handbook of Industrial Innovations, (1994); Miles I., Knowledge Intensive Services’ Suppliers and Clients, Ministry of Trade and Industry Finland Studies and Reports, (2003); Miles I., Innovation in Service, Handbook of Innovation, (2005); Utterback J., Abernathy W., A Dynamic Model of Process and Product Innovation, Omega, 3, pp. 639-656, (1975); Vernon R., International Investment and International Trade in the Product Cycle, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 80, pp. 190-207, (1966); Fisher J.C., Pry R.H., A Simple Substitution Model of Technological Change, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 3, pp. 75-88, (1971); Abernathy W.J., Clark K.B., Kantrow A.M., Industrial Renaissance: Producing a Competitive Future for America, (1983); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovations, (1962); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovations, (1995); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovations, (2003); Schumpeter J.A., Business cycles: A Theoretical, Historical and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process, (1939); Schumpeter J.A., The Theory of Economic Development, (1967); Rosenberg N., The directions of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices, Perspectives on Technology, (1976); Rosenberg N., Learning by Using, Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics, (1982); Nelson R., Winter S., In Search of a Useful Theory of Innovation, Research Policy, 6, pp. 36-76, (1977); Nelson R., Winter S., An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, (1982); Dosi G., Technological Paradigms and Technological Trajectories, Research Policy, 11, pp. 146-162, (1982); Pavitt K., The Management of Strategic Change.

Volatility is the most important financial indicator in the management of financial flows, as a measure of the risk of using a financial instrument at a specified period of time. Cryptocurrency mining technology is available to the general public and has become an innovative phenomenon. The latest financial phenomena need to be investigated, so it is necessary to conduct a multilateral scientific analysis, identification, and comparison of cryptocurrency with fiat currency. The aim of this study is to obtain new estimates of cryptocurrency based on the use of tools such as GARCH-model, simple historical volatility (SHV) and developed by the author's toolkit, which is based on the Chaikin method. The methodological basis of the research is logical, econometric, economic and statistical methods of analysis, technical and fundamental analysis, and method of scientific visualization. The calculated volatility estimates are based on the Central Bank's data on currency rates and investigated using named three models. The article for the first time presents the results of comparison of volatility of the leading fiat currencies (US dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen) and the most popular today so-called cryptocurrencies (bicoin, litecoin, ethereum, and monero). Estimation of volatility showed that the volatility of bitcoin is significantly higher than fiat money. In this regard, it is concluded that the recognition of cryptocurrency, in particular bitcoin, as a real money is premature, not only due to the lack of regulations of a certain cryptocurrency as a legal tender, but also on the grounds of violation of essential requirements for the properties of the currency, such as a low level of volatility. © 2018 OEconomia.

We define a ban as a policy whereby government agents refuse to accept an alternative currency and mete out punishments to private agents caught using it. After identifying monetary equilibria where an alternative currency is accepted, we then derive the conditions under which a ban might deter its use. As in earlier studies, we show that a government of sufficient size can prevent an alternative currency from circulating without relying on punishments. We also show that, given its size, a government can ban an alternative currency so long as it is willing and able to mete out sufficiently severe punishments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ban; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Currency; Endogenous matching; Money; Money matching; Political economy; Random matching; Transactions policy","","","","","","","","Aiyagari S.R., Wallace N., Government transactions policy the medium of exchange and welfare, J.

To diversify the sample, we include five very different countries in our study: Japan, Venezuela, China, Estonia, and Sweden. Using daily data over the period 2014–2017, we estimate the dynamic conditional correlation model between main stock indices and bitcoin price in local currencies (Bitflyer — in the case of the yen, Kraken — in the case of the euro, Huobi in the case of yuan and LocalBitcoins in all the remaining cases), as well as between main stock indices and the bitcoin price in the US dollar (Bitfinex exchange). We apply the Stochastic Volatility Model with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation. We add binary variables into the dynamic correlation equation, indicating the occurrence of extreme return on the stock-exchange index in the lower 1%, 5% and 10% quantile. The conclusions vary, depending whether we consider trade on the local bitcoin exchanges or in the global one. We conclude that bitcoin was treated as a safe haven asset only in the case of Venezuela and investments in bolivars. In the case of local investments in Japan and China bitcoin behaved as a diversifier. In the bitcoin-friendly economies of Sweden and Estonia it acted as a weak hedge. In the case of the USD trade, the results suggest that bitcoin is a weak hedge with respect to all of the analyzed markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Multivariate stochastic volatility; Safe haven","Cryptocurrency; Economic analysis; Financial markets; Investments; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wooden fences; Binary variables; Dynamic conditional correlations; Dynamic correlation; Economic situation; Local currencies; Safe haven; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Bitcoin","","","","","Poznan University of Economics and Business","The research is supported by the interdepartmental grant of Poznan University of Economics and Business : “The Future of money - cryptocurrencies , local currencies and cashless society”   ","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, (2009); Althauser J., (2017); Suberg W., (2018); Bouri E., Molnar P., Azzi G., Roubaud D., Hagforse L., On the hedge and safe haven properties of bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?, Finance Res.

Instead of top-down control, which is destined to eventually fail in a hyperconnected world, a bottom-up creation of value can unleash creative potential and drive innovations. Multiple currency dimensions can represent different externalities and thus enable the design of incentives and feedback mechanisms that foster the ability of complex dynamical systems to self-organize and lead to a more resilient society and sustainable economy. Modern information and communication technologies play a crucial role in this process, as Web 2.0 and online social networks promote cooperation and collaboration on unprecedented scales. Within this contribution, we discuss how one dimension of a multidimensional currency system could represent socio-digital capital (Social Bitcoins) that can be generated in a bottom-up way by individuals who perform search and navigation tasks in a future version of the digital world. The incentive to mine Social Bitcoins could sustain digital diversity, which mitigates the risk of totalitarian control by powerful monopolies of information and can create new business opportunities needed in times where a large fraction of current jobs is estimated to disappear due to computerisation. © 2016, The Author(s).","","","","","","","European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (316808, 324247)","","Helbing D., Nature, 497, (2013); Buldyrev S.V., Parshani R., Paul G., Stanley H.E., Havlin S., Nature, 464, (2010); Helbing, Interaction support processor, (2015); Helbing, Why we need a new economy to survive, (2016); Helbing, Social Self-Organization (Springer, (2012); Helbing, The self-organizing society – taking the future in our hands, (2015); Page S.E., The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies (Princeton Univ, Press, (2008); Arpe, (2016); Helbing, Implementing change in a complex world – responding to complexity in socio-economic systems: How to build a smart and resilient society?, (2015); Kleineberg K.K., Boguna M., Sci.

An economy in which Bitcoin is the dominant currency would be a more volatile and harsher economy, in which the government would have limited tools to fight recessions and where financial panics, once started, would be hard to stop. A key aspect of the Bitcoin protocol is that the total number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, after which no more will ever be issued. This makes Bitcoin appealing to many people because something that will never increase in supply is more likely to hold its value. The problem is that in the event of a crisis, there would also be no way to add liquidity to the system, as more Bitcoins cannot be printed.","","Disasters; Bitcoin; Electronic money","","","","","","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","","","","","","1099274X","","TEREA","","English","Technol Rev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046249264"

In this paper, we explore the features of jumps, which are discontinuous movements, by examining Bitcoin pricing. First, we identify jumps in the Bitcoin price on a daily basis, applying a non-parametric methodology and then break down the Bitcoin total rate of return into a jump rate of return and a continuous rate of return. In our empirical analysis, price jumps turn out to be independent of volatility. Moreover, the jumps in the Bitcoin price do not appear at regular intervals; rather, they tend to be concentrated in clusters during special periods, implying that once an economic crisis occurs, the crisis will last for a long time due to contagion effects and the economy will take a considerable amount of time to recover fully. Further, the contribution of the jump rate of return to the total rate of return of the Bitcoin price is lower than the contribution of the continuous return, implying that the pursuit of sustainable returns rather than large but temporary returns will improve the total rate of return over the long term. Finally, more jumps are observed when trading volume is lower, implying that market illiquidity drives discontinuous movement in asset prices. Overall, the features of jump risk are like two sides of the same coin and jump risks are expected to have a significant effect on asset pricing, suggesting that consideration of jumps is essential for risk management as well as asset pricing. © 2019 by the authors.","Bitcoin; Jump clustering; Jump risk; Volatility","cluster analysis; economic conditions; empirical analysis; management practice; methodology","","","","","","","Sahoo P.K., Bitcoin as digital money: Its growth and future sustainability, Theor.

The first question is - if cryptocurrency a new kind of money. It is difficult to answer this question definitely because till recent time the nature of money remained to be a subject of discussion. Now we have a good founded conception, which represents modern understanding of money. It is based on two principles. The first principle is the desire for wealth which exists in any human being, and in the human society as a social community. The second principle is the equality of exchange as a law of economy. Keeping in mind these two principles, we discover that mankind during the whole its history created and used only two kinds of economic operations, which are two kinds of equal exchange: trade and credit. First common economic operation in history was trade, while credit was rather an occasional one. So, money had emerged first from trade. The trade deal was performed by two independent participants. So, the only guaranty of equality of the exchange was the own value of the commodity which was used as money. This is why trade created commodity money, and the best commodities for this task were gold and silver. Credit created a verbal or a written agreement, which was an equivalent of the value of the loan. Commodity money was inconvenient for capitalism, and capitalism created its own money from the agreement between participants of the credit deal. It was possible because capitalism created close economic relations between people. Credit money is in accordance with the requirements of capitalist economy, it performs all necessary functions, it adapts good the influence of progress, and it is convenient for various needs. Modern capitalist economy doesn't need other kinds of money. Accepting this conception, we treat cryptocurrencies as tokens of various kinds, but not as money. In spite of the word ""currency"" in the name, these financial instruments are not currencies but tokens suitable for transfer money and some other needs. The anonymity of the deals with these instruments, the absence of public control and some other qualities of that kind became the reason of strong demand for cryptocurrencies and of the rise of their price, especially the price of bitcoins. Flight of capital, some other illegal deals, as well, as the possibility of rapid enrichment attracted people to operations with bitcoins but the rise and fall of its price exposed the scale of risks of such operations. Nevertheless, the main merit of cryptocurrencies is the blockchain system. This system can be successfully used in various industries where exists a need for fixing big numbers of items or of operations. This reasons demand from government economic policy to be careful and wise. The state has time to wait until the processes in this sphere will become more clear and stable. The same approach must be implemented to government regulation of ICO as a new method of attracting investments for business projects. The fact that many deals of that kind were used just to take off money from people must not became a reason to ban these deals. Blockchain system, cryptocurrencies and ICO create a new civil financial society with some kind of self-regulation. Such processes are typical for contemporary time, but they don't mean introducing a new kind of money. The digital revolution will create its own way of interaction of these instruments with existing credit money, and the new system will inevitably demand some sort of state regulation. © 2018 Nauka Publishing House.

We apply an economic analysis of blockchains based on both new institutional economics and public choice economics.Our main focus is on the economics of why banks exist as organizations (rather than a world in which all financial transactions occurring in markets), and how banks are then impacted by technological change that affects transaction costs.Our core argument is that blockchains are more than just a new technology to be applied by banks, but rather compete with banks as organizations, enabling banking transactions to shift out of centralized hierarchical organizations and back into decentralized markets. Blockchains are a new institutional technology—because of how they affect transaction costs in financial markets—that will fundamentally re-order the governance of the production of banking services. We then explore this implication through broader political economy lens in which banking moves out of organizations and deeper into markets. We examine this as a form of institutional economic evolution in which the boundary of catallaxy—i.e., a self-organized economy—is enlarged, at the margin of the banking sector. Such institutional competition enables evolutionary discovery in the institutions of banking. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Austrian economics; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Catallaxy; Cryptocurrency; New institutional economics","","","","","","","","Allen D.W., The institutional revolution: Measurement and the economic emergence of the modern world, University of Chicago Press, (2011); Allen D., Discovering and Developing the Blockchain Cryptoeconomy, (2016); Atzori M., Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: is the State Still Necessary?, (2015); Bohme R., Christin N., Edelman B., Moore T., Bitcoin: Economics, technology, governance, J.

To this end, it introduces the reader to VCs in general and decentralised convertible VCs (""DCVCs"") in particular. Due to their design and interaction with the real economy and currency, DCVCs are on the radar of many financial regulators worldwide. As Bitcoin is considered the leading type of DCVC in terms of value and volume, its early beginnings in South Africa are probed. Although regulation should follow innovation, awareness of the VC ecosystem will not only warrant appropriate regulatory intervention when the time comes, but will also enable the growth and development opportunities associated with VCs. South Africa has not promulgated any legislation pertaining to VCs. The potential applicability of all current legislation and regulations relevant to VCs calls for in-depth research. This article aspires to serve as an appetiser to do so. © 2015, North-West Unversity.

The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security. © 2019 The Authors","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Contract signing; Cryptocurrency; Digital economy; Digitalization; E-commerce; Ethereum; Fair exchange; Fintech; Trust; Trust-free system","Bitcoin; Cost benefit analysis; Electronic commerce; Electronic money; Ethereum; Contract signing; Digital economy; Digitalization; Fair exchange; Fintech; Trust; Trust-free system; Blockchain","","","","","European Social Fund, ESF","This work is partially financed by the European Social Fund and the Spanish Government under projects TIN2014-54945-R and RTI2018-097763-B-I00.","Andrychowicz M., Dziembowski S., Malinowski D., Mazurek L., Fair two-party computations via bitcoin deposits, International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 105-121, (2014); Asokan N., Schunter M., Waidner M., Optimistic protocols for fair exchange, Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, pp. 7-17, (1997); Asokan N., Shoup V., Waidner M., Asynchronous protocols for optimistic fair exchange, Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 86-99, (1998); Bao F., Wang G., Zhou J., Zhu H., Analysis and improvement of micali's fair contract signing protocol, Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy, pp. 176-187, (2004); Ben-Or M., Goldreich O., Micali S., Rivest R.L., A fair protocol for signing contracts, IEEE Trans.

New digital 'alt-finance' systems, including the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin and similar 'cryptocurrencies,' are no exception: technology, rhetoric, imagined users and non-users, and a long history of sociotechnical, political, and cultural relations are all elements in a dynamic assemblage with wide-ranging consequences. This paper examines the rise and fall of one alt-finance system: MazaCoin, a Bitcoin variant intended to benefit the Oglala Lakota of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The story of MazaCoin is one of an attempt to unite two apparently divergent sociotechnical assemblages: (1) a libertarian, elite technology of cryptocurrency, and (2) a richly traditional indigenous community with a deep desire for cultural survivance, bound up in a precarious economy left behind in the wake of more than a century of genocide.","","","","","","","","","Barlow J.P., A declaration of independence of cyberspace, Electronic Frontier Foundation, (1996); Bradbury D., MazaCoin aims to be sovereign altcoin for native Americans, Coindesk, (2014); Bratta P., Powell M., Entering the cultural rhetorics conversations, Enculturation, 21, (2016); Carrigan M., A summer of television poverty porn, Sociological Imagination, (2013); Consunji B., Engel E., No country for cryptocurrency, (2014); Deloria V., Custer died for your sins: An Indian manifesto, (1988); Dougherty T.R., Knowing (y)our story: Practicing decolonial rhetorical history, Enculturation, 21, (2016); Ecoffey B., Oglala Sioux tribe surprised by MazaCoin plan, Indianz.com, (2014); Ferreira J., McKnight J., Fish A., Perry M., Interpreting infrastructure: Defining user value for digital financial intermediaries, (2015); Gilyard K., Race, rhetoric, and composition, (1999); Hamill J., The battle of little Bitcoin: Native American tribe launches its own cryptocurrency, Forbes, (2014); Jensen T., Welfare commonsense, poverty porn and doxosophy, Sociological Research Online, 19, 3, (2014); King L., Gubele R., Anderson J.R., Survivance, sovereignty, and story: Teaching American indian rhetorics, (2015); Kranzberg M., Technology and history: 'Kranzberg's laws, Technology and Culture, 27, 3, pp. 544-560, (1986); Landry A., 9 questions surrounding MazaCoin, the Lakota cryptoCurrency: Answered, Indian Country, (2014); Maza; McKnight J., Fish A., A sensible lamb portfolio: Constructing peers in peer to peer lending, ephemera; Lakota nation adopts MazaCoin crypto-currency as legal tender, (2014); Schell E.E., Rawson K.J., Rhetorica in motion: Feminist rhetorical methods & methodologies, (2010); Smith L.T., Decolonizing methodologies: Research and indigenous peoples, (2012); Sprague J., Feminist methodologies for critical researchers: Bridging differences, (2005); Suzack C., Huhndorf S.M., Perreault J., Barman J., Indigenous women and feminism: Politics, activism, culture, (2010); Spatial","","","First Monday","","","","","","13960466","","","","English","First Monday","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996605379"

In this essay, I argue that cryptocurrencies and blockchains are important objects of general social science research and thought, but not for their ‘moneyness’ per se. Through a historical sociology of the antecedents and discourse leading up to Bitcoin, I show that it was never meant to be ‘money’ in the economic sense, but rather a solution to a technical puzzle for preventing opportunistic actors from double-spending digital ‘coins,’ as well as a fervent ideology surrounding online privacy and infringement of individual rights in the digital age. Drawing from themes in science and technology studies, I suggest that Bitcoin and other ‘cryptoassets’ are properly socio-technological assemblages that constitute new and important objects of social inquiry that must be understood beyond the myopic context of crypto-money. I conclude by proposing three alternative ontologies for blockchains relevant to economic, political, and social life: as systems of accounting, as organizational forms, and as institutions in their own right. © The Author(s) 2019.","assemblages; Bitcoin; blockchain; economy; money; technology","","","","","","","","Alston L.J., Mueller B., Property rights and the state, Handbook of New Institutional Economics, pp. 573-590, (2008); Bech M., Garratt R., Central bank cryptocurrencies, BIS Quarterly Review, 55, (2017); Besley T., Persson T., The origins of state capacity: Property rights, taxation, and politics, American Economic Review, 99, 4, pp. 1218-1244, (2009); Bjerg O., How is Bitcoin money?, Theory, Culture & Society, 33, 1, pp. 53-72, (2016); Brands S., Untraceable off-line cash in wallet with observers, Advances in Cryptology: CRYPTO ‘93, pp. 302-318, (1993); Broadberry S., Gupta B., The early modern great divergence: Wages, prices and economic development in Europe and Asia, 1500–1800, Economic History Review, 59, 1, pp. 2-31, (2006); Buterin V., Visions, Part I: The value of blockchain technology, (2015); Callon M., Introduction: The embeddedness of economic markets in economics, The Sociological Review, 46, S1, pp. 1-57, (1998); Carruthers B.G., Espeland W.N., Accounting for rationality: Double-entry bookkeeping and the rhetoric of economic rationality, American Journal of Sociology, 97, 1, pp. 31-69, (1991); Chaum D., Blind signatures for untraceable payments, Advances in Cryptology, pp. 199-203, (1983); Chaum D., Security without identification: Transaction systems to make big brother obsolete, Communications of the ACM, 28, 10, pp. 1030-1044, (1985); Chaum D., Fiat A., Naor M., Untraceable electronic cash, Advances in Cryptology: CRYPTO ’88, pp. 319-327, (1988); Davidson S., De Filippi P., Potts J., Blockchains and the economic institutions of capitalism, Journal of Institutional Economics, 14, 4, pp. 639-658, (2018); Dai W., B-money, (1998); DeFilippi P., Wright A., Blockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code, (2018); Diffie W., Hellman M., New directions in cryptography, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 22, 6, pp. 644-654, (1976); Dillard D., Money as an institution of capitalism, Journal of Economic Issues, 21, 4, pp. 1623-1647, (1987); Dodd N., The Social Life of Money, (2014); Dodd N., The social life of Bitcoin, Theory, Culture & Society, 35, 3, pp. 35-56, (2018); Dwork C., Naor M., Pricing via processing or combatting junk mail, Advances in Cryptology: CRYPTO ’92, pp. 139-147, (1993); Even S., Goldreich O., Yacobi Y., Electronic wallet, Advances in Cryptology, pp. 383-386, (1984); Golumbia D., The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism, (2016); Graeber D., Debt: The First 5,000 Years, (2012); Grigg I., Triple entry accounting, Systemics Inc, (2005); Hayes A., Cryptocurrency value formation: An empirical study leading to a cost of production model for valuing Bitcoin, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1308-1321, (2017); Hayes A., Bitcoin price and its marginal cost of production: Support for a fundamental value, Applied Economics Letters, (2018); Hendrickson J.R., Hogan T.L., Luther W.J., The political economy of Bitcoin, Economic Inquiry, 54, 2, pp. 925-939, (2016); Hodgson G.M., Economics and institutions, Journal of Economic Issues, 40, 1, pp. 1-25, (1988); Hughes E., A cypherpunk’s Manifesto, (1993); Humayun M., Belk R.W., ‘Satoshi is dead.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate how to maximize the opportunities that allow Bitcoin in contributing for Indonesia tax revenue and also, the respond to the growing issues of virtual money transactions in the world. This study uses Literature study method based on some previous research and scientific journals that discuss about Bitcoin as a means of payment in sale and purchase transactions.

While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, the authors are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns (TPs), as observed during the period from 2009 to 2015. The authors are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. They conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e. gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: Data mining. Findings: Four primary business categories are identified in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. Common patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users are a “one-day” holding period for bitcoin transactions is somewhat typical. That is, a one-day effect where traders, gamblers, black market participants and miners tend to cash out on a daily basis. There seems to be a strong preference to do business within the bitcoin economy in round lot amounts, whether it is more typical of traders exchanging for fiat money, gamblers placing bets or black market goods being bought and sold. Distinct patterns of transaction behavior among the business categories and their users are flows between traders and exchanges average just around 20 BTC, and traders buy or sell on average every 11 days. Meanwhile, gamblers wager just 0.5 BTC on average, but re-bet often within the same day. Three marked regimes have evolved, as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprises (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises. This evolution of the Bitcoin economy suggests a trend toward legitimate commerce. Originality/value: The authors propose a new theoretical framework that allows investigating and exploring the network of payment relationships in the Bitcoin economy. This study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses), and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what is called “super clusters”, by using tested techniques from the literature. A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized. The novelty of this study is given by the pure user group and the TP analyses, by means of which the authors are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Business analysis; Digital currencies; Network theory; Payment traceability","","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P031730/1)","","Androulaki E., Karame G.O., Roeschlin M., Scherer T., Capkun S., Evaluating user privacy in bitcoin, Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 34-51, (2013); Antonopoulos A.M., Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies, (2014); (2017); Branwen G., Black market risks, (2015); Doll A., Chagani S., Kranch M., Murti V., (2014); Garcia D., Tessone C.J., Mavrodiev P., Perony N., The digital traces of bubbles: Feedback cycles between socio-economic signals in the bitcoin economy, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 11, 99, pp. 20140620-20140623, (2014); Hayes A., Cryptocurrency value formation: an empirical study leading to a cost of production model for valuing Bitcoin, (2016); Kaminsky D., Black ops of tcp/ip, (2011); Koshy P., Koshy D., McDaniel P., An analysis of anonymity in bitcoin using p2p network traffic, International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 469-485, (2014); Weak privacy guarantees for SharedCoin Mixing service, (2015); Lischke M., Fabian B., Analyzing the bitcoin network: the fi four years, Future Internet, 8, 1, (2016); Meiklejohn S., Pomarole M., Jordan G., Levchenko K., McCoy D., Voelker G.M., Savage S., A fistful of bitcoins: characterizing payments among men with no names, Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Internet Measurement Conference, ACM, pp. 127-140, (2013); Moser M., Bohme R., Anonymous alone?

Design/methodology/approach: A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings: To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value: This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attribution; Bitcoin regulation; Cryptocurrency; Financial crime; Ransomware","","","","","","","","Ablon L., Libicki M.C., Golay A., Markets for Cybercrime Tools and Stolen Data: Hackers’ Bazaar, (2014); Ajello N., Fitting a square peg in a round hole: bitcoin, money laundering and the fifth element of self-incrimination, Brooklyn Law Review, 80, 2, pp. 435-461, (2013); Arghire I., NotPetya – destructive wiper disguised as ransomware, (2017); Ashford W., Cyber criminals make it difficult to follow the money, (2017); Submission to the financial system inquiry: digital currencies and bitcoin, a proposed self-regulatory model for Australia, (2014); International operation targets users of darknet marketplaces, (2016); Digital currency – game changer or bit player, report, Australian senate economics references committee, (2015); Part a of an AML/CTF program, (2016); WannaCry ransomware bitcoins more from online wallets, (2017); Biggs T., Petya’ cyberattack: what we know about the latest global ransomware strike, (2017); Bogage J., Bitcoin’s not money, judge rules as she tosses money-laundering charge, (2016); Bonneau J., Miller A., Clark J., Narayanan A., Kroll J.A., Felten E.W., SoK: research perspectives and challenges for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 104-121, (2015); Botezatu B., Massive GoldenEye ransomware campaign slams worldwide users, (2017); Camenisch J., Hohenberger S., Lysyanskaya A., Compact e-cash, Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT, pp. 302-321, (2005); Chaum D., Blind signature for untraceable payments, Advances in Cryptology-Eurocrypt 82, pp. 199-203, (1982); Crypto-currency market capitalizations, (2014); Crypto-currency market capitalizations, (2017); Coldewey D., Analysts think petya ‘ransomware’ was built for targeted destruction, not profit, (2017); Digital currency-game changer or bit player, (2015); Cook J., Banks are stockpiling bitcoins in case they get hit with ransomware, (2016); Das S., Bitcoin sees strict rule proposals by the european commission, (2016); Del Castillo M., The ‘Great bitcoin exodus’ has totally changed New York’s bitcoin ecosystem, (2015); Dillet R., Germany recognizes bitcoin as ‘Private money’, Sales tax coming soon, (2013); Eskandari S., Barrera D., Stobert E., Clark J., A first look at the usability of bitcoin key management, pp. 1-12, (2015); Protect your computer: don’t be scared by ‘scareware, (2010); Application of FinCEN’s regulation of persons issuing physical or digital negotiable certificates of ownership or precious metals, (2015); Wannacry, the biggest ransomware outbreak ever, (2017); Hern A., Ransomware attack ‘not designed to make money’, researchers claim, (2017); Virtual currencies and beyond: initial considerations, monetary and capital markets, legal and strategy and policy review departments, (2016); Irwin A.S.M., Milad G., The use of crypto-currencies in funding violent jihad, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 19, 4, pp. 407-425, (2016); Irwin A., Slay J., Choo R., Liu L., Are the financial transactions conducted inside virtual environments truly anonymous? an experimental research from an Australian perspective, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 16, 1, pp. 6-40, (2013); Kageyama Y., Watt L., Ransomware ‘WannaCry’ attack: Asia reports thousands of new cases, (2017); Kien-Meng L.M., Coining bitcoin’s ‘Legal-bits’: examining the regulatory framework for bitcoin and virtual currencies, Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, 27, 2, pp. 587-606, (2014); Khandelwal S., Turns out new petya is not a ransomware, it’s a destructive wiper malware, (2017); Kharpal A., Hackers who infected 200,000 machines have only made $50,000 worth of bitcoin, (2017); Regulation of bitcoin in selected jurisdictions, (2014); Martin J., Lost on the silk road: online drug distribution and the ‘cryptomarket, Criminology and Criminal Justice, 14, 3, pp. 351-367, (2014); Middlebrook S., Bitcoin for merchants: legal considerations for businesses wishing to accept bitcoins as a form of payment, (2014); Mungo P., Glough B., Approaching Zero: The Extraordinary Underworld of Hackers, Phreakers, Virus Writers, and Keyboard Criminals, (1992); New York codes, Rules and regulations, Title 23, (2015); Digital currency: you can’t flip this coin!

At the paper's heart is the paradox that if Bitcoin succeeds in its own terms as an ideology, it will fail in practical terms as a form of money. The main reason for this is that the new currency is premised on the idea of money as a ‘thing’ that must be abstracted from social life in order for it to be protected from manipulation by bank intermediaries and political authorities. The image is of a fully mechanized currency that operates over and above social life. In practice, however, the currency has generated a thriving community around its political ideals, relies on a high degree of social organization in order to be produced, has a discernible social structure, and is characterized by asymmetries of wealth and power that are not dissimilar from the mainstream financial system. Unwittingly, then, Bitcoin serves as a powerful demonstration of the relational character of money. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Bitcoin; economy; money; technology","","","","","","","","Benes J., Kumhof M., The Chicago Plan revisited, IMF Working Paper WP/12/202, (2012); Birch D., Identity is the New Money, (2013); Borges J.-L., Funes the Memorious, Labyrinths, pp. 87-95, (2000); Bryan D., Rafferty M., Capitalism with Derivatives, (2006); Clippinger J.H., Bollier D., Introduction, From Bitcoin to Burning Man and Beyond: The Quest for Identity and Autonomy in a Digital Society, (2014); De Goede M., Speculative Security: The Politics of Pursuing Terrorist Monies, (2012); Desan C., Making Money: Coin, Currency and the Coming of Capitalism, (2014); Dodd N., The Sociology of Money, (1994); Dodd N., Reinventing monies in Europe, Economy and Society, 34, 4, pp. 558-583, (2005); Dodd N., The Social Life of Money, (2014); Fisher I., 100% Money: Designed to Keep Checking Banks 100% Liquid; to Prevent Inflation and Deflation; Largely to Cure or Prevent Depressions; and to Wipe Out much of the National Debt, (1935); Fisher I., 100% money and the public debt, Economic Forum, April–June, pp. 406-420, (1936); Golumbia D., Bitcoin as politics: Distributed right-wing extremism, MoneyLab Reader: An Intervention in Digital Economy, pp. 117-131, (2015); Graeber D., Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams, (2001); Graeber D., Debt: The First 5,000 Years, (2011); Graeber D., The Democracy Project: A History.

The methods used are the wavelet transform modulus maxima and the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis.

This debate is poised between two related but ultimately incompatible techno-economic imaginaries: infrastructural mutualism and digital metallism. Each offers a theory not just of money, but also of relations, identities, and the larger imaginaries we call ‘society’ and ‘the economy’. In particular, they offer distinct visions of what it means to be a ‘peer’ in a peer-to-peer money system, and perhaps, a peer-to-peer society.

Originally devised to support the Bitcoin digital currency, it is expected to be applied to a broad range of financial applications as well as in various other sectors such as distribution and sharing economies. This broader application requires that several technical challenges including data privacy protection and better processing performance be addressed, and Fujitsu Laboratories is working on several relevant R&D projects.

In other words, the Social and Solidarity Economy is a socio-economic area based on three main axes that determine its transforming character: democratic and participatory management, orientation towards human needs and commitment to the environment. In this way, it represents a new way of doing things, rather than a path towards a specific goal. In Spain, with the approval of the Social Economy Law in 2011, the sector has experienced a significant boost and growth in recent years. At the same time, new technologies are representing a disruptive change in our current society and are modifying the way we relate to each other. At this point, it is important to differentiate between the Internet of information and the Internet of value. The first is the tool that enables the free circulation of information throughout the planet and has led to the creation of new business models such as Google, Facebook or Amazon, among others. As for the Internet of value, based precisely on blockchain technology, it is the tool that makes possible to share and manage the value of assets or goods in a digital and decentralized way, without the need to depend on a trusted entity that centralizes the process. Blockchain technology, released in 2009 by Bitcoin, is a decentralized database that is distributed among a multitude of different participants. This distribution system establishes a system of group trust, since the information is distributed among different agents, it cannot be altered. Blockchain will revolution the future development of economies and societies, with a potential capable of transforming both industry and services, as well as social relations. In this case, the initiative has started in the financial sector mainly, although as it is evident, its application in the future will not have to be exclusive to that sector. The emergent development of blockchain technology and its possibilities to modify the forms of solidarity collaboration of citizens present a current challenge and a paradigm shift for the Third Sector. Today, society is changing the way to inform, to communicate and to relate. Faced with this reality, it is increasingly aware of its transforming role and driving agent of change. The significant evolution that information technologies have undergone in recent years has affected all sectors, including the Social and Solidarity Economy. For this reason, the aim of this article is to analyze the combination of the concept of Social and Solidarity Economy and blockchain, analyzing the possibilities of both areas sharing values, principles and objectives. The Social and Solidarity Economy framework developed by Chaves and Monzón (2018), as well as Corrons, Fuster and Espelt (2017), is mainly used for this purpose. In the first place, the concept of Social and Solidarity Economy and its current framework are analyzed, highlighting its three main vertebral axes. On the other hand, and based on the research led by Preukschat on blockchain, in addition to the definition of the concept, the levels at which it is stratified are identified: structure, properties, functional characteristics and usability. In order to complete the study, an analysis of the socioeconomic implications and barriers presented by this technology is presented. In short, the blockchain offers an opportunity to give authenticity to what is understood by collaborative with respect to the proposals that exist today. However, the main barriers that this technology presents are related to the implications of the current socioeconomic system. It provides freedom of action to individuals in the face of oligopolies, large corporations and States. The free exchange of crypto currencies implies no need for banks. The privacy of economic transactions implies the difficulty of taxation by States. And global and universal registration, without anyone being able to manipulate it, implies that all transactions are stored forever and, therefore, that there is no place for the right to forget or to a second chance. At present, there is a lack of research and studies that deal with this new technology, its possibilities and barriers to adapt to the consolidated concept of Social Economy. In this way, this analysis focused mainly on the study of existing literature, shows how blockchain technology has become the new paradigm in the Third Sector and how it can be the basic tool for changing the behavior of citizens in solidarity issues. In the near future, the disruptive technologies are called to cause a great impact in the traditional systems in benefit of the citizens, forcing to a vindication of the inefficient and obsolete current schemes. Here is where blockchain technology, configured in a way compatible with the principles of the Social Economy, can become a key tool that strengthens the Social Economy sector, that allows it to continue growing up and that manages to increase the impact of the aims of the entities that make it up. © 2019 CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa.","Blockchain; Governance; Social and solidarity economy; Technology; Values","","","","","","","","Bech M., Garrat R., Criptomonedas de los bancos centrales, (2017); Belzunces M., Blockchain: què és i com ens canviarà la vida, (2017); Bretos I., Morandeira J., La economía social ante la actual crisis económica en la comunidad autónoma del País Vasco, REVESCO, Revista de Estudios Cooperativos, 122, pp. 7-33, (2016); Cabezas J., Blockchain: el futuro ya no es lo que era, (2016); Canigueral A., Cap a una economia col·laborativa «responsable», Revista Oikonomics, 6, (2016); Chaves R., Monzon J.L., La economía social ante los paradigmas económicos emergentes: innovación social, economía colaborativa, economía circular, responsabilidad social empresarial, economía del bien común, empresa social y economía solidaria, CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa, 93, pp. 5-50, (2018); Chaves R., Zimmer A., El Tercer Sector en España y en Europa: crisis y resilencia, (2017); Corrons A., Fuster M., Espelt R., Economia Social i Solidària a l'àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona: contextualització i situació actual, (2017); Blockchain: economía de confianza.

We conclude that Bitcoin, a truly interesting experiment, exemplifies ""distributed capitalism"" and should be mostly seen as a technological innovation. Rather than providing pragmatic answers and solutions to the current views on the financial crisis, Bitcoin provides some useful and timely questions about the principles and bases of the dominant political economy.","Bitcoin; Commons; Cryptocurrency; Digital currencies; Distributed capitalism; Money; Open source; P2P money","","","","","","","","Babaioff M., Dobzinski S., Oren S., Zohar A., On Bitcoin and Red Balloons, Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 56-73, (2012); Barber S., Boyen X., Shi E., Uzun E., Bitter to Better-How to Make Bitcoin a Better Currency, Proceedings of Financial Cryptography.

Importantly, blockchain represents a data architecture, whose application goes far beyond Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain and has popularized the technology. In the health sector, blockchain is being aggressively explored by various stakeholders to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient outcomes, enhance compliance, and enable better use of healthcare-related data. However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as 'revolutionary' and 'disruptive', is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is 'fit-for-purpose' is pivotal. This concept forms the basis for this article, where we share views from a multidisciplinary group of practitioners at the forefront of blockchain conceptualization, development, and deployment. © 2019 The Author(s).","Blockchain; Clinical trials; Distributed ledger technology; Electronic health records; Genomics; Health informatics; Healthcare technology; Medical licensure; Supply chain","Biomedical Technology; Computer Communication Networks; Data Warehousing; Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Data Processing; Equipment and Supplies Utilization; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Management Information Systems; Medical Informatics; Medical Records; adult; article; consumer; controlled study; economic aspect; electronic health record; genomics; health care need; human; licensing; medical informatics; physician; computer network; data warehouse; health care delivery; high throughput screening; information processing; information system; medical record; medical technology; organization and management; procedures","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI, (R00HG009680); National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI","T-TK acknowledges support from the National Human Genome Research Institute (https://www.genome.gov) of the US National Institutes of Health under Award Number K99HG009680 and R00HG009680.

It also examined four of the ostensible benefits which at the same time constitute risks, from the legislation of cryptocurrency. Quantitative data were sourced from the respondents through the administration of a structured questionnaire. The population for the study comprised a stratified group of 1,300 Chartered Accountants among whom were Tax Practitioners, Financial Analysts, Statutory Auditors, Bankers, Accountants, Lawyers, Lecturers and other specialists in the field of Accounting. A sample of 250 Practitioners was conveniently selected for the study. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the Professional Accountants in Nigeria are willing to operate in the Cryptocurrency environment provided the Government would legislate its use. The study concluded that the legislation of Cryptocurrency or its modified form by the Federal Government of Nigeria is desirable for the protection of her economy as well as the interest of her citizens. However, government must take holistic view of the economy and scrutinize every relevant factor in the purview of the law to ensure the legislative decision is in the interest of the entire citizens. © 2018, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Legislation; Nigeria; Professional accountants","","","","","","","","Akinyemi B., Okoye A.E., Izedonmi F., History and development of accounting in perspective, International Journal of Sustainable Development Research, 1, 2, pp. 14-20, (2015); Back A., Hashcash-A denial of service counter-measure, (2002); Baron J., O'Mahony A., Manheim D., Dion-Schwarz C., National security implications of virtual currency examining the potential for non-state actor deployment, (2015); Bartoletti M., Carta S., Cimoli T., Saia R., Dissecting Ponzi schemes on Ethereum: Identification, analysis, and impact, (2017); Bech M., Garratt R., Central bank Cryptocurrencies, BIS Quarterly Review, pp. 55-70, (2017); Belomyttseva O.S., Conceptual framework for the definition and regulation of virtual currencies, International and Russian Practices, 61, 5, pp. 32-39, (2015); Virtual currencies, micropayments and monetary policy, (2014); Bhosale J., Mavale S., Volatility of select crypto-currencies: A comparison of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, Annual Research Journal of Symbiosis Centre for Management Studies, 6, pp. 132-141, (2018); Bruck T., Wickstrom B., The economic consequences of Terror: Guest editor's introduction, The European Journal of Political Economy, 20, pp. 293-300, (2004); Carlisle D., Virtual currencies and financial crime challenges and opportunities, (2017); Chaum D., Blind signatures for untraceable payments Advances in Cryptology, Proceedings of Crypto, 82, 3, pp. 199-203, (1983); Chaum D., Fiat A., Naor M., Untraceable electronic cash, CRYPTO 88 Proceedings on Advances in Cryptology, pp. 319-327, (1988); Chris R., Sascha K., Ricarda B., Virtual currencies like Bitcoin as a paradigm shift in the field of transactions, International Business & Economics Research Journal, 14, 4, (2015); Digital currencies, (2015); Conti M., Kumar S.E., Lal C., Ruj S., A survey on security and privacy issues of Bitcoin, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 20, 4, pp. 3416-3452, (2017); Davies G., A history of money from ancient times to the present day, (Third Edition), (2002); Dierksmeier C., Seele P., Cryptocurrencies and business ethics, Journal of Business Ethics, pp. 1-14, (2016); Virtual currency schemes, (2012); Everette J., Risks and vulnerabilities of virtual currency: Cryptocurrency as a payment method, (2017); Virtual currencies, (2016); Carlisle D., Virtual currencies and financial crime challenges and opportunities, (2017); Reducing costs and scaling up service provision for remittance flows from the UK to Africa, (2017); Forstater M., Taxation and primitive accumulation: The case of colonial Africa, The Nature, Origins, and Role of Money: Broad and Specific Propositions and Their Implications for Policy, (2005); Gaudamuz A., Marden C., Blockchains and Bitcoin: Regulatory responses to Cryptocurrencies, First Monday, 20, 2, (2015); Gilbert S., Loi H., Digital currency risk, International Journal of Economics and Finance, 10, 2, pp. 108-123, (2018); Godlove J.D.N., Regulatory overview of virtual currency, Oklahoma Journal of Law and Technology, 10, 1, pp. 1-67, (2014); Grech A., Camilleri A.F., Blockchain in education, (2017); Haber S., Stornetta W.S., Secure names for Bitstrings, Proceedings of the 4th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security, (1997); Hameed S., Farooq S., The art of crypto currencies: A comprehensive analysis of popular Crypto Currencies, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7, 12, pp. 426-435, (2016); Hansen J.D., Boehm J.L., Treatment of Bitcoin under U.S. property law, (2017); Hauxley R., A short history of crypto euphoria finance & development: An eminent economist's taxonomy of bubbles is applied to the latest financial fad, A Quarterly Publication of the International Monetary Fund, 55, 2, pp. 20-21, (2018); He D., Monetary policy in the digital age: Crypto assets may one day reduce demand for central bank money, A Quarterly Publication of the International Monetary Fund, 55, 2, pp. 20-21, (2018); Henry J.F., The social origins of money: The case of Egypt, European Journal of Political Economy, 14, pp. 407-432, (2004); Hughes S.J., Middlebrook S.T., Advancing a framework for regulating Cryptocurrency payments intermediaries, Yale Journal on Regulation, 32, 2, pp. 495-559, (2015); Ingham G., Babylonian madness: On the historical and sociological origins of money, What is Money, 1, pp. 16-41, (2000); Monetary and financial statistics manual and compilation guide, (2016); Classifying cryptocurrencies, (2018); Johnson R.B., Nedelescu O.M., The impact of terrorism on financial markets, (2005); Johnston D.J., The future of money.

Its ascendancy offers up a puzzle for financial regulators and other law-enforcers worldwide, while also promising to fulfill the political visions of a group of marketanarchist cryptographers. While it is still a very small economy in absolute terms, Bitcoin also poses some interesting challenges to traditional economic institutions, and is thus an interesting case for economic sociology. Using the notion of material embeddedness, this paper examines the possible implications of a further propagation of Bitcoin. If the currency proves a success, this will have ramifications for a large number of economic institutions, such as the possibility of taxation of untraceable money, the credit economy and interest rates, and international currency control. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Bitcoin; Crypto-anarchy; Cryptography; Embeddedness; Institutions; Markets; Trust; Virtual currencies","","","","","","","","Alcantara J., Alcantara J., Alcantara J., Letters to the Editor, The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association, 57, 1, pp. 97-98, (2013); Androulaki E., Karame G.O., Roeschlin M., Scherer T., Capkun S., Evaluating User Privacy in Bitcoin.

Indeed, some governments have already taken steps to ban or discourage the use of bitcoin. In a model with endogenous matching and random consumption preferences, we find multiple monetary equilibria including one in which bitcoin coexists with official currency. We then identify the conditions under which government transactions policy might deter the use of bitcoin. We show that such a policy becomes more difficult if some users strictly prefer bitcoin because they can avoid other users holding the official currency in the matching process. © 2016 Western Economic Association International.","","","","","","","","","Aiyagari S.R., Wallace N., Government Transaction Policy, the Medium of Exchange, and Welfare, Journal of Economic Theory, 74, 1, pp. 1-18, (1997); (2014); Calvacanti R., Wallace N., A Model of Private Bank-Note Issue, Review of Economic Dynamics, 2, 1, pp. 104-136, (1999); Christin N., pp. 213-223, (2013); Clinch M., (2013); Corbae D., Temzelides T., Wright R., Matching and Money, American Economic Review, 92, 2, pp. 67-71, (2002); Corbae D., Temzelides T., Wright R., Directed Matching and Monetary Exchange, Econometrica, 71, 3, pp. 731-756, (2003); (2013); Goldberg D., Money with Partially Directed Search, Journal of Monetary Economics, 54, 4, pp. 979-993, (2007); Grinberg R., Bitcoin: An Innovative Alternative Digital Currency, Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal, 4, 1, pp. 159-208, (2011); Hendrickson J.R., Luther W.J., (2014); Hogan T.L., Luther W.J., (2014); (2014); Kiyotaki N., Wright R., A Search-Theoretic Approach to Monetary Economics, American Economic Review, 83, 1, pp. 63-77, (1993); Li Y., Wright R., Government Transaction Policy, Media of Exchange, and Prices, Journal of Economic Theory, 81, 2, pp. 290-313, (1998); Lotz S., Rocheteau G., On the Launching of a New Currency, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 34, 3, pp. 563-588, (2002); Luther W.J., (2015); Luther W.J.; Luther W.J.; Luther W.J., Olson J., Bitcoin Is Memory, Journal of Prices & Markets, 3, 3, pp. 22-33, (2015); Luther W.J., White L.H., Can Bitcoin Become a Major Currency?, Cayman Financial Review, 36, pp. 78-79, (2014); Madore P.H., Final New York Bitcoin Regulation Released: BitLicense, Crypto Coin News; Matonis J., (2013); Middlebrook S.T., Hughes S.J., Regulating Cryptocurrencies in the United States: Current Issues and Future Directions, William Mitchell Law Review, 40, 2, pp. 813-848, (2014); Miedema B., (2013); Nakamoto S., (2008); (2013); Salter A.W., Luther W.J., Synthesizing the State and Spontaneous Order Theories of Money, Advances in Austrian Economics, 18, pp. 161-178, (2014); Selgin G., On Ensuring the Acceptability of a New Fiat Money, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 26, 4, pp. 808-826, (1994); Waller C.J., Curtis E.S., Currency Restrictions, Government Transaction Policies and Currency Exchange, Economic Theory, 21, 1, pp. 19-42, (2003); White L.H., The Market for Cryptocurrencies, Cato Journal, 35, 2, pp. 383-402, (2015)","","","Blackwell Publishing Inc.","","","","","","00952583","","","","English","Econ.

The aim of our paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the payment and investment features of Bitcoin, and their implications for the conduct of e-commerce. Since network externality theory suggests that the value of a network and its take-up are interlinked, we investigate both adoption and price formation. We discover that its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin's popularity, the sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants who have adopted this technology, and we model the share of sales paid for with this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. Our analysis examines how country-, customer-, and company-specific characteristics interact with the proportion of sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company features, use of other payment methods, customers' knowledge about Bitcoin, and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are significant determinants. The results will be of interest to traders who seek to understand factors driving prices and will help to inform vendors as to the most favorable circumstances for adopting the currency for online transactions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; digital money; electronic money; emerging technologies; financial services; online payments; peer-To-peer network; technology adoption","","","","","","Faculty of Economic Sciences and Management, Nicolaus Copernicus University, (1479-E (2013); National Bank of Poland; Polish Bank Association; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; University of Leicester, UoL","Funding text 1: MICHAL POLASIK (michal.polasik@umk.pl) is an assistant professor on the Faculty of Economic Sciences and Management at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland.

Answering this question requires obtaining collective behavioural traces generated by the activity of a large number of actors. Digital currencies offer a unique possibility tomeasure socio-economic signals fromsuch digital traces. Here,we focus on Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has experienced periods of rapid increase in exchange rates (price) followed by sharp decline;we hypothesize that these fluctuations are largely driven by the interplay between different social phenomena. We thus quantify four socio-economic signals about Bitcoin from large datasets: price on online exchanges, volume of word-of-mouth communication in online social media, volume of information search and user base growth. By using vector autoregression, we identify two positive feedback loops that lead to price bubbles in the absence of exogenous stimuli: one driven bywordof mouth, and the other by newBitcoin adopters.We also observe that spikes in information search, presumably linked to external events, precede drastic price declines. Understanding the interplay between the socio-economic signals we measured can lead to applications beyond cryptocurrencies to other phenomena that leave digital footprints, such as online social network usage. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This trade is ruled or governed by several protocols, which limits the over flooding or inappropriations in the exchange markets. One such virtual currency that is becoming popular among users is Bitcoin. In this paper, we discussed the evolution of Bitcoin as a currency, situations preceding and aftermath, as well as its consequences and effects on the present economy. We also discussed its growth, transaction volumes, currency acceptability, and factors involved. In this paper, we have tried to ensemble related thoughts for seeking new ideas for developing an alternative financial system. The results attained thereof could give new hopes to both consumers and markets seeking more freedom in terms of volume, payment methods, anonymity, and so forth.","Bitcoin; Currency; Dollar; Transaction volume; Volatility","","","","","","","","Babaioff M., Dobzinski S., Oren S., Zohar A., On Bitcoin and red balloons, Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce (EC 12), pp. 1-18, (2012); Barber S., Boyen X., Shi E., Uzun E., Bitter to better - how to make Bitcoin abetter currency, Financial Cryptography and Data Security. 16th International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2012, pp. 399-414, (2012); 10 reasons why the value of Bitcoin is skyrocketing, (2015); Bohme R., Christin N., Edelman B., Moore T., Bitcoin, (2014); Brito J., Castillo A., Bitcoin: A primer for policymakers, pp. 1-10, (2013); Elwell C.K., Murphy M.M., Seitzinger M.V., CRS: Bitcoin: Questions, answers, and analysis of legal issues, (2015); Figure 1.

The paper implements the Wavelet Power Spectrum (WPS), the Wavelet Coherency (WTC), and the Cross-Wavelet (XWT) techniques. There is a positive correlation between the related variables. However, the findings indicate that there are significant regime changes in both Bitcoin returns and the TPI during the periods of 2010–11 and 2017–18. In addition, there is a significant and negative causal relationship that runs from the TPI to the returns of Bitcoin during the related periods. Overall, the paper finds that trade policy uncertainty significantly and negatively affects the Bitcoin returns during the periods of regime changes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency markets; Portfolio choice; The USA economy; Trade policy uncertainty","","","","","","","","Aguiar-Conraria L., Soares M.J., Business cycle synchronization and the Euro: a wavelet analysis, J.

On one side are the supporters, who see its potential to create a true, peer-to-peer (p2p) sharing economy. On the other side are the critics, who argue that the blockchain is more likely to reproduce capitalism than to disrupt it. Using the insights generated by the critical literature on the blockchain, this paper seeks to ask new questions and provide new insights about the development of this technology and how it is likely to transform the global political economy through its capacity to enforce global property rights. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bitcoin; blockchain; globalization; property; sharing economy; technology","capitalism; economic development; globalization; Internet; political economy; property market","","","","","","","Alexander D., (2019); Allen D.W.E., Berg C., Novak M., Blockchain: An entangled political economy approach, Journal of Public Finance and Public Choice, 33, 2, pp. 105-125, (2018); Andreasyan T., FinTech Futures, (2016); Arcidiacono D., Gandini A., Pais I., Sharing what?

The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","Bitcoins; Cryptocurrency; Security threats; User privacy","Blockchain; Data privacy; Miners; Network protocols; Network security; Security systems; Surveys; Bitcoins; Distributed consensus; Incentive compatible; Privacy preserving solutions; Security and privacy; Security and privacy issues; Security threats; User privacy; Electronic money","","","","","EU-India, (ICI+/2014/342-896); Innovative Machine Learning Techniques; Physical-Layer Security for Wireless Communication, and Content Centric Networking: Security and Privacy Issues; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (321980, 688061); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Marie Curie; European Commission, EC, (H2020-ICT30-2015-688061, PCIG11-GA-2012-321980); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (20103P34XC); Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD","Manuscript received June 30, 2017; revised December 23, 2017, March 4, 2018, April 25, 2018, and May 21, 2018; accepted May 29, 2018.

Distinctive characteristic properties of a set of cryptocalculation units, in particular, subsets of x-type (coin) and y-type (token) calculation units, are revealed. It is proved that these sets do not intersect. It is proposed to allocate a subset of C 2 in the set of coins, which has an additional characteristic property - functioning on the basis of a smart contract. The thesis that any settlement unit carries the cost of a resource is proved. Even for units of account with the so-called ""intrinsic value"" (bitcoin), the presence of a resource in its functions was found. Four characteristic properties inherent in the set of ""money"" (M = {money}) are disclosed and a subset DM = {digital money} is allocated, containing a set of digital Fiat money secured by the state (sets F = {fiat}) and a subset P = {private}, which is actually an addition to the set F). It is proved that cryptocurrencies have characteristic properties of the set M = {money} only within their own community. The paradox of the algorithmic guarantor, reflecting the absence of the need for formalization of algorithmic informal institutions, is formulated. Disclosed definitions of such concepts as ""cryptocurrency"", ""token economy"" and ""tokenization economy"". Euler circles are used to visualize the relationship between different sets of calculation units. A coherent classification of calculation units based on the characteristic properties of the identified sets is formed. The results of the study can be used to form the basis of legal regulation of the circulation of digital units of account. © 2018 Finance: Theory and Practice.

In particular, the study aims to gain understanding if Bitcoin would bring about a paradigmatic shift toward a cashless society. The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter's model of economic development. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The study also compares Bitcoin with PayPal, a similar digital currency and major online payment system, to gain insights of the new challenge toward a cashless economy. The parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signify a move from a cash-based economy toward a less cash society. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Bitcoin; cashless; innovation; payment system; technology S-curve","","","","","","","","Abernathy W.J., Clark K.B., Kantrow A.M., Industrial Renaissance: Producing A Competitive Future for America, (1983); Ali R., Barrdear J., Clews R., Southgate J., Innovations in payment technologies and the emergence of digital currencies, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Quarter, 3, pp. 1-14, (2014); Bouoiyour J., Selmi R., Tiwari A.-K., Is Bitcoin business income or speculative foolery?

Originality of this research is represented by revealing correlation between formation of Bitcoin's exchange rate and such factors as number of transactions and number of queries in Wikipedia with the help of econometric methods. In order, we could study formation of currency exchange rate, we performed analysis of stationary state of time series, defined the moment of change in trend's incline that was connected with changing structure, we built VECM Model and impulse response functions. We have also performed Ljung-Box test for the presence of residual autocorrelation. We have revealed correlation between In-transformed number of transactions and prices for Bitcoin for the whole period and during the period before structural changed.

Cryptography-based currencies, called as cryptocurrencies, are now leading the world’s economy. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges have emerged to support cryptocurrency-related services. Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin takes the lead and it is widely accepted by the world community. Lots of security issues are arising day by day and the exchange should handle all of of them sensibly. It is necessary that the exchange should be solvent all the time in terms of its assets and liabilities for its survival. For this, periodic settlement of the accounts should be done using appropriate techniques. The information exchange needed for this should be concealed from the adversaries. Cryptography-based techniques with zero-knowledge protocols are suitable for this purpose. Maxwell’s proof of liabilities is the first cryptography-based method to verify the user assets. It makes use of binary Merkle hash trees for representing the proof of liabilities. The root node reveals the total assets of the exchange, which will attract the adversaries to execute an attack. Later the Dagher et al scheme, a privacy preserving proof of asset for bitcoin exchanges, was proposed. The scheme works in an interactive manner that requires the collaboration of the exchange and the user. This paper proposes an efficient non-interactive proof of assets for bitcoin exchanges. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.","bitcoin exchange; commitment scheme; Cryptocurrency; non-programmable random oracle model; proof of assets; zero-knowledge proof","Binary trees; Cryptography; Data privacy; Knowledge management; Bitcoin; Commitment scheme; proof of assets; Random Oracle model; Zero knowledge proof; Electronic money","","","","","","","Belenkiy M., E-cash, Handbook of financial cryptography and security, pp. 4-48, (2011); Parhonyi R., Micropayment systems, Handbook of financial cryptography and security, pp. 161-183, (2011); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, vol. 1, (2008); Okamoto T., Ohta K., Universal electronic cash, Proceedings of CRYPTO 91, LNCS, 576, pp. 324-337, (1992); Wilcox Z., Proving Your Bitcoin Reserves, (2014); Merkle R.C., Secrecy, Authentication and Public Key Systems, (1979); Dagher G.G., Bunz B., Bonneau J., Clark J., Boneh D., Provisions: Privacy preserving proofs of solvency for bitcoin exchanges, Proceedings of ACM CCS 2015, pp. 720-731, (2015); Pedersen T., Non-interactive and information-theoretic secure verifiable secret sharing, Proceedings of Advances in Cryptology—CRYPTO 91, pp. 129-140, (1991); Damgard I., On the existence of bit commitments schemes and zero knowledge proofs, Proceedings of CRYPTO’89, 435, pp. 17-27, (1989); Damgard I 2010 on ∑ Protocols, (2010); de Santis A., Micali S., Persiano G., Non-interactive zero knowledge proof systems, Proceedings of Advances in Cryptology-CRYPT’87: A Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, pp. 52-72, (1987); Chaidos P., Groth J., Making sigma protocols non-interactive without random oracles, Proceedings of PKC 2003, 9020, pp. 650-670, (2015); Ogburn M., Turner C., Dahal P., Homomorphic encryption, Proc.

The point of this policy change is to hopefully prevent the amount of crime that results from the proliferation of cash. However, there are potential negative consequences to this policy change that receive little to no attention and there are several misconceptions regarding the opportunistic nature and resourcefulness of organized crime. As such, this paper aims to attempt to study these potentially negative consequences to provide some warning to countries adopting a cashless economic policy. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper relying upon an understanding of the literature in the fields of sociology, anthropology, psychology and criminology as applied to the topic of money and economic policy. Findings: This paper discusses numerous negative effects to adopting a cashless economic policy, to include the proliferation of underground financing through the hawala system and organized criminal channels, the increased use of Bitcoin, the more difficult task of tracking currency through bank reporting requirements, and the potential effect of increasing other crimes, which are harder to track. Research limitations/implications: This is an entirely conceptual paper. As such, it is not able to state definitively whether the outcomes discussed will occur or to what extent it may occur. Practical implications: This paper could help to serve as a warning for governments wishing to adopt a cashless economic policy, and it may encourage those countries to hopefully develop safeguards to prevent some of the potentially negative effects that might result. Social implications: This paper expands upon the understanding of money and the various ways that individuals may adapt or react culturally, psychologically or violently to changes in monetary policy or the form of currency itself. Originality/value: There have been few if any paper discussing the consequences of cashless economic policies and its implications toward organized crime. This paper is unique in both the subject matter being discussed and the conceptual arguments it puts forth. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cashless; Corruption; Money; Money laundering; Organized crime","","","","","","","","Abdirahman A., US banks move ruining the lives of families in Somalia, (2015); Ariely D., The Honest Truth about Dishonesty, (2013); Ayoola T., The effects of cashless policy of government on corruption in Nigeria, International Review of Management and Business Research, 2, 3, pp. 682-690, (2013); Baker W., Jimerson J., The sociology of money, American Behavioral Scientist, 35, 6, pp. 678-693, (1992); De Mesquita B., Smith A., The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics, (2012); Ekiti G., INEC boss decries huge cost of organizing elections in Nigeria, Vanguard, (2015); Goodhart C., Can Central banking survive the IT revolution?, International Finance, 3, 2, pp. 189-209, (2000); Ikpefan O., Achugamonu B., Isibor A., Agwu E., Fraud, unemployment and cashless system: a paradox or reality in Nigeria, British Journal of Economics, Finance, and Management Sciences, 10, 1, pp. 29-42, (2015); Ingersoll E., Wampum and its history, The American Naturalist, 17, 5, pp. 467-479, (1883); Capital: Volume I, (1976); Nwankwo O., Eze O., Electronic payment in cashless economy of Nigeria: problems and prospect, Journal of Management Research, 5, 1, pp. 138-151, (2013); Olusola M., Oludele A., Ogbonna C., Osundina S., Cashless society: drive’s and challenges in Nigeria, International Journal of Information Sciences and Techniques, 13, 2, pp. 1-11, (2013); Radford R., The economic organization of a POW camp, Economica, 12, 48, pp. 189-201, (1945); Senn P., Cigarettes as currency, The Journal of Finance, 6, 3, pp. 329-332, (1951); Sharman J., The Money Laundry: Regulating Criminal Finance in the Global Economy, (2011); Timberlake R., The significance of unaccounted currencies, The Journal of Economic History, 41, 4, pp. 853-866, (1981); Timberlake R., Private production if scrip-money in the isolated community, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 19, 4, pp. 437-447, (1987); Woodford M., Monetary policy implementation: past, present and future?, International Finance, 3, 2, pp. 229-260, (2000); Wright R., Tekin E., Topalli V., McClellan C., Dickinson T., Rosenfeld R., Less cash, less crime: evidence from the electronic benefit transfer program, (2014)","J.W.

Indeed, over the past 8 years equity market bubble of 2014-2015, real estate bubbles of 2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2015-2017 and bitcoin market bubble of 2016 were in the spotlight. Upon close analysis it is found that the bubbles were provoked by the policy of the authorities. The formation of a bubble forces regulators to implement restrictive measures, but at the same time the authorities stimulate the emergence of a rush demand on another market. Investors' funds flow into another market, which leads to the formation of a new bubble. Maintenance of markets in overheating condition is a very atypical policy. It is necessary to clarify what mechanisms are used by the Chinese authorities for markers's overheating and cooling. It is also important to understand the goals of such a policy in order to analize China's economy and to make predictions of further PRC development. It is illustrated in this article that the main reason to push the authorities to create conditions for bubble emergence is the necessity to stimulate private consumption. In China, there is a historically determined problem of the abnormally high propensity to save. The creation of bubbles is an attempt to overcome population habits, an effort to ""accustom"" the Chinese not to put all the money into a deposit or ""under the mattress"". Investing part of the funds in investment goods with almost guaranteed high yield, the Chinese receive additional income, and, as statistics show, they increase consumption.","China; Consumer demand; Economic policy; Equity market; Real estate market","","","","","","","","A Goring Concern The Economic Dangers of China's Manic Bull Market; Erken H., Giesbergen B., Every M., How Serious Is China's Housing Market Bubble?; Orlik T., China's Trouble with Bubbles; Pettis M., Avoiding the Fall: China's Economic Restructuring, (2013); Pettis M., The Great Rebalancing: Trade, Conflict, and the Perilous Road ahead for the World Economy, (2013); Pettis M., The Limit to Beijing's Financial Guarantee; Pettis M., Will China's New ""Supply-Side"" Reforms Help China?; Rothman A., What Next?

Decentralization comes with a price, however: blockchains do not scale-they are incapable of processing a large, or even moderate, number of transactions in a timely manner. For example, bitcoin processes three transactions per second. The root of the problem-and the limiting factor for blockchains-is a trustless peer-to-peer network model, in which information must be suboptimally propagated to- and validated at-every hop in the network. Undoubtedly, cloud-delivery networks (e.g., Akamai or YouTube), which resolved similar performance challenges in other domains (e.g., web and video delivery), could help scale blockchains as well. The problem is that such large centralized infrastructures disturb the decentralized nature of blockchains, hence eliminating their disruptive potential. The question is, can cloud-delivery networks be used to scale blockchains without upsetting their decentralized nature? The answer is positive, and the key to the solution lies in an advanced version of an existing concept: net neutrality. Blockchain and the cryptocurrency revolution initiated by bitcoin in 20088 are thriving.The market capitalization of prominent cryptocurrencies, while highly volatile, continues to be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. A unique feature of blockchains is the lack of centralized administration. They rely on third-party mediation, (i.e., a global peer-to-peer network of participants who validate and certify all transactions). Given the purely distributed and decentralized design of blockchains, many people believe that such systems have a disruptive potential in other areas beyond cryptocurrencies, including health care, government, manufacturing, retail, insurance, The Internet of things, the sharing economy, etc. Numerous high-tech companies, big and small, are closely watching the blockchain space, analyzing how the new technology could affect their existing or future operations. A major problem for blockchains is scalability. The blockchain system throughput is measured in the number of TPS (transactions per second) a system can support. Bitcoin's current average throughput of three TPS compares to 2,000 TPS average throughput in Visa's centralized system, 4,000 TPS daily peak, and 56,000 TPS maximum capacity. Without scalability, cryptocurrency systems will hardly become mainstream, and blockchains are unlikely to realize their disruptive potential in any other areas.

The first scenario ""supranational money"" involves the introduction of a global reserve currency operated beyond the jurisdiction of any particular country. This scenario is based on the transformation of the IMF into a bank of central banks, conversion of SDRs into a systemic standard of value, introduction of symmetric rights and obligations between creditors and debtors to finance payment imbalances, transition to real rather than nominal fixed exchange rates, re-direction of virtual capital flows to priority service of real sector of the economy, creating a liquid market for SDR-denominated bonds. The analysis of viability of ""gold re-monetization"" scenario stems from comparison of the views of leading American economists on the prospects of restoring various forms of the gold standard - from the classical one with reestablishing of the monetary functions of gold to the quasi-golden variant realized through a 100% bank reserve system. In ""monetary polycentrism"" scenario the attention is drawn to the fact that introduction of the Euro failed to ensure financial sovereignty of the member countries of the Eurozone and to prevent economic de stabilization of the European economic and monetary union. It is emphasized that the federalization of Europe in the banking, budgetary, fiscal and political spheres as well as intensive internationalization of Renminbi could serve as the basis for creating real alternatives to US dollar hegemony in the world, followed by the formation of currency blocks in Eurasia with the participation of Russia and China. In ""digital currency"" scenario the authors develop the hypothesis of using crypto currency (bitcoin and its analogues) for expanding the virtual market space in order to form a global financial cybernetic system that is not controlled by state organizations and transnational corporations. The authors come to the conclusion that Russia needs to seriously prepare for implementation of all analyzed scenarios while relying on its own historic experience in creating alternative international trading and monetary system. © 2018 Nauka Publishing House.

Since then, the hash calculations to mine Bitcoin have been getting more and more complex, and consequently the mining hardware evolved to adapt to this increasing difficulty. Three generations of mining hardware have followed the CPU's generation. They are GPU's, FPGA's and ASIC's generations. This work presents an agent-based artificial market model of the Bitcoin mining process and of the Bitcoin transactions. The goal of this work is to model the economy of the mining process, starting from GPU's generation, the first with economic significance. The model reproduces some ""stylized facts"" found in real-time price series and some core aspects of the mining business. In particular, the computational experiments performed can reproduce the unit root property, the fat tail phenomenon and the volatility clustering of Bitcoin price series. In addition, under proper assumptions, they can reproduce the generation of Bitcoins, the hashing capability, the power consumption, and the mining hardware and electrical energy expenditures of the Bitcoin network. © 2016 Cocco, Marchesi.

Active global crypto currency market growth ""overwhelming"" national economic systems contributes to the formation of a new type of economic relations which makes supply chain as the crucial factor in development. Despite the fact that at the current time in the world community a single (unified) approach to the legal regulation of the crypto currency market has not yet been developed, crypto currency is considered by many world regulators as a promising tool in the monetary policy of national economies. In this regard, it seems extremely urgent to solve the problem which reveals the features of the studied market development, as well as the possibility of its forecasting for short- and medium-term periods of time. The research subject is the process of economic and mathematical modelling of time series characterizing the bitcoin exchange rate volatility, based on the use of artificial neural networks. The purpose of the work is to search and scientifically substantiate the tools and mechanisms for developing prognostic estimates of the crypto currency market development. The paper considers the task of financial time series trend forecasting using the LSTM neural network for supply chain strategies. The time series composed of the BTC / USD currency pair data is analysed; the period analysed is a day. The authors analysed the neural network architecture, built a neural network model taking into account the heterogeneity and random volatility of the time series, developed and implemented an algorithm for solving the problem in the Python system. For training the neural network, data were used for the period from September 24, 2013, to March 17, 2019 (a total of 2002 data sets). The experiment boils down to that the constructed neural network model is trying to determine the trend of the time series for one next timeframe. The training was conducted with a ""teacher"". To determine the prediction error, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated. The results of the study are of practical interest for both government authorities in the field of crypto currency market regulation and for representatives of the business community, who are integrated or planning to integrate into the global crypto currency transaction system. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Artificial neural networks; Forecasting; LSTM; Machine learning; Supply chain management; The architecture of artificial neural networks; Time series","","","","","","","","Arkhangelskaya E.V., Kadurin A., Nikolenko S.I., Deep Learning.

Regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance. Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Accessibility; Adoption intention; Bitcoin; Competition; Consumer demand; Costs; Crypto-payments; Cryptocurrency; Digital economy; Economic analysis; Fintech innovation; Intermediaries; Network externalities; Retailers; Two-sided markets","Bitcoin; Competition; Costs; Economic analysis; Electronic money; Regression analysis; Sales; Accessibility; Adoption intention; Consumer demands; Crypto-payments; Digital economy; Intermediaries; Network externality; Retailers; Two-sided markets; Electronic commerce","","","","","","","Aydogan S., Insights on Consumer Payment Behavior: What Factors Determine and Allow to Influence the use of Payment Instruments?, (2016); Betaalvereniging Annual report, (2015); Bolt W., Van Oordt M., On the value of virtual currencies, J.

At the same time, the existing regulatory mechanisms and legislation do not create optimal conditions for the development of the market of new financial instruments and technologies in Russia today. There are socio-economic risks, the key ones including an increase in the outflow of capital and innovative projects to other countries, a lack of confidence on the part of potential investors in new financial instruments, a decrease in the stability of traditional financial institutions. On this basis, the following tasks have been set in this article. To consider the terminology in the field of digital economy from the theoretical aspect; to identify trends and justify the need for digitalization of economic processes based on the use of new financial technologies; to reveal the informative characteristics of financial technologies promising for Russia. This article ends with a conclusion that the development of the digital economy in Russia is due to the need to ensure the information and economic security of the state, realize the potential of the new economy to improve the standard of living and national well-being through the introduction of innovative communication and financial technologies.

Being a new phenomenon, Crypto economy causes both great enthusiasm and serious concerns related to its impact on the environment. The amount of electricity consumed by Crypto economy is comparable to the annual consumption by such countries as Chile and Venezuela. The influence of Crypto economy on the planet's ecosystem is growing at a significant pace. Even though there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin mining contribution to the overall consumption of electricity by the cryptocurrency industry is crucial. To understand the alternative cost of maintaining a cryptocurrency industry infrastructure and its impact on the Earth's ecosystem, different electricity consumption models considered and corresponding carbon footprint model introduced. The carbon footprint model based on a third-party estimate of global electricity consumption by the industry and geographical distribution of mining facilities educated guess coming from the internet traffic distribution of mining pools login pages. This approach allowed considering 8 out of top-10 mining pools responsible for the majority of network hashrate. The resulting carbon dioxide emissions taking bitcoin mining yearly electricity consumption equal 73.12 TWh is 40.88 million tons of CO2, which is 0.12% of global carbon dioxide emissions. © 2019 Franco Angeli Edizioni.

Specifically, we distinguish three factors of supply and demand, real economic factors, and psychological factors, and examine the effect of these variables on Bitcoin price. This is related to the issues that crypto-currency can function like real money, or it can replace financial investment assets such as existing stock markets as an investment alternative, what effect it has on the real economy, and it will rely on investors’ attention and psychology. The results of this study show that the price of Bitcoin is more influenced by investors’ attention and psychological factors such as Naver trend index and newspaper articles, rather than being influenced by rational variables such as supply and demand variables or real economic variables. This means that Bitcoin fever and downfall were more likely to be irrational bubbles than were supported by economic value. © 2019, Korean Securities Association.

The underlying model is an indivisible goods / indivisible money, dual currency search model similar to that in Kiyotaki and Wright (1993) and Curtis and Waller (2000). In such models, there are two pure Nash equilibria - total acceptance or total rejection of the secondary currency - and one unstable, mixed equilibrium. This mixed equilibrium is considered an artifact of the indivisibility of money and goods in the model and is often ignored. I find that when a significant friction - in this case the inability to barter - is introduced, the equilibrium tends towards complete acceptance of the secondary currency. Conversely, when barter is readily available to subjects, the equilibrium tends towards total rejection. As predicted by theory, the tendency towards one equilibrium or the other appears to be influenced by the mixed equilibrium and the related basins of attraction. © 2019","Cryptocurrency; Currency shortage; Macro experiment; Secondary currency","","","","","","Center for Analytical Finance at UC Santa Cruz; UC Santa Cruz Department of Economics; University of California, Santa Cruz, UCSC; Ecological Society of America, ESA","I would like to thank two anonymous referees, Gabriele Camera, John Duffy, Dan Friedman, Jeff Hummel, Janet Hua Jiang, Curtis Kephart, Ken Kletzer, Luba Peterson, Hikaru Saijo, Carl Walsh, and Cathy Zhang for their helpful comments.
